            <h2>Submit to Us</h2>
            
            <p> For poetry, please submit 3-5 poems for consideration. Submissions should be attached all in a single file
                in the form of a Word, Open Office, or Google document or a PDF. To get a feel for our style, feel free 
                to roam around our <a href="issues/">literary magazine</a> or our <a href="http://thepaperplanepilots.com">literary blog</a>
                For fiction, our word count limit has no minimum (feel free to run with that) and the maximum is 2,500 words.
                For screenplays, yes, you totally heard us right. <!-- Since we are based in Los Angeles, we have decided to shine more 
                of a light on screenwriters as writers. Do you know who wrote your favorite movie? Most people don’t. So, we’re 
                publishing short screenplays. The art of screenwriting does not need to hide behind the scenes. As far as page 
                count, there is no minimum, maximum would be eight pages. -->
            </p>
            <p> Simultaneous submissions are totally fine with us but please PLEASE please notify us as soon as humanly possible 
                if it is published elsewhere. Previously published work is okay, just let us know where so we can give proper credit 
                where it’s due. 
            </p>
            <p> Unfortunately, we cannot offer any form of payment at this time. We allow one submission per issue per 
                person. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>Submissions for our April 2015 issue are currently open! Please email your poetry and short fiction to 
            <a href="mailto:thepaperplanepilots@gmail.com">thepaperplanepilots@gmail.com</a> by March 1st.</b>
