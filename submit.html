            <h2>Submit to Us</h2>

            <h3> Poetry </h3>
            <p> For poetry, please submit <b>3-5 poems for consideration.</b> Submissions should be attached <b>all in a single file</b>
                in the form of a Word, Open Office, Google document or a PDF. To get a feel for our style,
                you can roam around our <a href="issues/">literary magazine</a> or our <a href="http://thepaperplanepilots.com">literary blog</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Fiction</h3>
            <p> For fiction, our word count limit has no minimum (feel free to run with that)
                and <b>the maximum is 2,500 words.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
            <p> <b>Simultaneous submissions</b> are totally fine with us but please PLEASE please <b>notify us as soon as humanly possible</b>
                if it is published elsewhere. Previously published work is okay, just let us know where so we can give proper credit
                where it’s due.
            </p>

            <p> Unfortunately, we cannot offer any form of payment at this time.
            </p>

            <p> We allow one submission per issue per
                person. <b>Please put your name in the name of the file.</b>
            </p>

            <p> Submissions for our <b>July 2016 issue</b> are currently open! Please <b>email your poetry and short fiction to</b>
            <a href="mailto:thepaperplanepilots@gmail.com">thepaperplanepilots@gmail.com</a> by <b>June 1st.</b>
            </p>

            <p> <b>We generally respond to submissions 2-3 weeks after the due date.</b>
