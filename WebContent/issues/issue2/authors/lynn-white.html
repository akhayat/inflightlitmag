White lives in North Wales. Her work is influenced by issues of
social justice, events she has witnessed, and people she has known or
imagined. Her poem 'A Rose For Gaza' was</FONT> shortlisted for the
Theatre Cloud <I>War Poetry for Today</I> competition and has since
been published. Poems have also recently been included, or are
forthcoming, in Harbinger Asylum's <I>A Moment To Live By</I>
anthology, the One Love Foundation's <I>Love Anthology,</I> <I>Anomalie,</I>
<I>Sonic Boom</I> and <I>Phizzog</I> among others. The poem 'God Save
the Sheep' was inspired by a local controversy. Sadly, the sheep
prevailed!</FONT></FONT></BODY>
