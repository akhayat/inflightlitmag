	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jennette Karla Simpson's eyes
	grew large while she inhaled a deep breath of calm retribution. With
	her lungs filled, the twelve-year-old, green-eyed blonde briefly
	paused. She then blew out a bright smile of delayed satisfaction. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Feeling as if she'd steadied
	herself, Jennette looked at her foster brother and nodded upward for
	him to continue. &quot;Go ahead, Jimmy,&quot; she puffed. &quot;I'm
	ready now.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy returned the nod and
	cleared his throat. In one hand he held a bible; in his other hand,
	Jimmy gripped a toy, plastic teapot. Within the teapot was water
	that he and Jennette, along with Jennette's two younger siblings,
	Carrie and Conrad Simpson, collectively blessed just minutes before.
	</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy raised the teapot over
	his head, and, mimicking their favorite movie, <I>The Exorcist</I>,
	he thrust the pink-toy forward, causing water to fly in the
	direction of three adults. The adults flinched but could not move.
	Gagged with red bandanas, the three adults sat bound to chairs.
	Resolute in their construction, the iron seats were firmly bolted to
	the bedroom floor. Strapped to the chairs were the children's foster
	parents, Charles and Sandy Davis, along with their adult son,
	Steven. 	</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Armed with guns taken from their
	foster father's hidden collection, Jennette and Jimmy easily coerced
	the adults into the gothic chairs of restraint.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy lifted his arm and, again,
	plunged the teapot forward. He then made a horizontal wave at the
	three adults, forming a protective cross in the process. &quot;Evil
	spirits, be gone,&quot; he shouted while droplets of water shot from
	a hole in the teapot's spout, randomly spreading across the adults'
	faces and torsos.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Get behind us, Satan,&quot;
	Jennette added with a spirited yell. She then walked to the chair
	where her twenty-seven-year old foster bother sat. She grabbed the
	back of the chair and, checking its stability, tried to shake it.
	The chairs were previously used for punishment purposes, restraining
	an endless drove of frightened foster children. They were also used
	to keep the children from getting into the refrigerator when they
	were left home alone for extended periods of time.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jenette rattled the chair one
	more time and then, again, nodded upward toward Jimmy. &quot;It's
	secure,&quot; she whispered. Jennette then took her place in line
	between Jimmy and Conrad, who was next to Carrie. Together the four
	foster children formed a linear, holy gauntlet.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Up and down the line, the four
	youth exchanged looks and smirks. They knew that the evil they had
	endured was nearly over. Soon they would be able to move about
	freely without care or angst. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>No one outside the dingy
	walls, however, knew of the travesty within the foster home. Not
	even the social worker who placed the children knew of the horrors.
	Not unexpected though, as the home was a bit remote. Not wanting to
	put any unnecessary miles on her new Buick's, three-year, limited
	warranty, the social worker had only had phone contact since
	dropping off the children and no contact for several weeks.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy threw more water on the
	three adults. &quot;We take no pleasure,&quot; he said, &quot;in
	ending the terror that we have fallen victim to&hellip;&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Interrupting, Jennette patted
	Jimmy on the back. She cleared her throat and whispered, &quot;Wait
	a second, Jimmy.&quot; She then walked back toward Steven's chair.
	This time Jennette stopped directly in front him. She turned
	slightly and, with all of her might, sprang her right leg forward,
	kicking him in the genitals. &quot;You like that?&quot; she shouted,
	and began to laugh.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Steven bent forward. With a
	grimaced face and bobbing head, he groaned from the immense pain;
	followed by several coughs and gags for air.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you do like
	that,&quot; Jennette said, with a sarcastic smirk. &quot;And my
	answer to that very same question, is no!&quot; She kicked him
	again. &quot;I don't like it! And I never did like you touching me.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Steven gagged and nearly threw up
	in the handkerchief that was firmly pressed against his lips and
	cheeks.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jennette smiled victoriously,
	curtseyed and then took her place next to Jimmy. &quot;You may
	continue, Sir Jimmy.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy smirked and shrugged.
	&quot;Maybe,&quot; he continued, &quot;we do take some pleasure in
	ending the terror.&quot; He then nodded in the direction of Conrad
	and Carrie, asking, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jennette watched Conrad and
	Carrie smile while enthusiastically nodding their heads. She turned
	to Jimmy. &quot;I think it's time. But before we do this, Jimmy, I
	want to thank you for all that you have done to help me and my
	little brother and sister. We will never forget you.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jennette then turned and nodded
	upwards, giving Carrie and Conrad the signal. In unison, as if
	choreographed, Jennette, Carrie and Conrad slowly approached their
	abusers. Within inches of the foster family that was paid to protect
	them, Jennette held out her arm restraining her younger siblings. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Carrie, holding a thick
	wooden paddle, and Conrad, with a heavy leather belt wrapped around
	his right fist, giggled and wiggled in their stance. Filled with
	anticipation, Carrie and Conrad were anxious to recompense their
	foster family for some of the pain they had incurred and endured all
	these months.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>With a warm smile, Jennette
	stepped in front of her younger siblings. She first addressed her
	bound foster mother. &quot;Hello, Sandy,&quot; Jennette said,
	followed by a stream of spit to Sandy's face. Jennette then rubbed
	out a twitch in her nose and turned her attention towards her foster
	father. Nodding, she said, &quot;Hey, Charles, what's up?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Anticipating spit or pain,
	Charles's eyes widened, and his face scrunched red.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nice look, Charles,&quot;
	Jennette said with a giggle. She then began to slowly pace back and
	forth, stopping in front of Steven. &quot;The cookies I made, and
	that you all ate so plentifully&hellip;&quot; Jennette smiled and
	faked like she was going to kick Steven again.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Steven flinched and a loud shriek
	was heard from beneath the handkerchief.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Conrad and Carrie covered
	their lips and giggled again.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jennette also chuckled at
	Steven's reaction. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well,&quot; she
	continued. &quot;The delicious cookies were filled with all the
	powder from Sandy's pills.&quot; Jennette scooted in front of Sandy
	and leaned to get eye-to-eye. &quot;You know the pills I'm talking
	about.&quot; Jennette smiled. &quot;The ones that make you feel all
	good inside, and that help you go to sleep at night.&quot; Jennette
	paused. &quot;But!&quot; she shouted and raised her right arm in the
	air, &quot;did you know that your son gave them to me as well?&quot;
	She pointed at Steven. &quot;Oh yeah, momma bear, your baby boy
	wanted to make me feel all gooey inside? He fed me your liquor too,
	but you already knew that, didn't you?&quot; Jennette paused again,
	briefly. &quot;But none of that matters now.&quot; Jennette
	chuckled, and then shook her head. &quot;Man you had a lot of
	capsules stocked up; and so many doctors to give them to you. I'm
	glad though, because it helped make the batter so chewy and, well,
	from the looks of it, quite enjoyable&hellip;&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So,&quot; Jimmy
	interrupted. &quot;You'll be asleep very soon.&quot; He smiled,
	mischievously. &quot;And you won't feel a thing; except the first
	hit that is.&quot; Jimmy nodded to Jennette, Carrie and Conrad. &quot;Now
	remember guys, only a few hits; we don't want to kill them.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>The three adults gasped.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Shortly thereafter, when the
	adults were fully sedated, semi-conscious and slightly bloodied,
	Jimmy took a picture of the three enslaved abusers. He used the
	Polaroid camera that Steven had recently purchased and frequently
	used on Jennette while in compromising positions. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Once Charles, Sandy, and
	Steven were completely passed out, Jennette and Jimmy, with the
	assistance of Carrie and Conrad, moved them to their beds. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>After securing Steven atop
	his mattress, Jimmy took a look around and sighed. &quot;Almost
	over,&quot; he whispered. He then ordered Jennette and the younger
	children out of the house, &quot;Get anything you want and that you
	can carry,&quot; Jimmy instructed. &quot;And take the good cookies
	and milk and whatever else is in the fridge. Put them into the
	wagon. But be quick about it. Then get out!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy waited for the young
	ones to clear the house. He then took another look in on the
	Charles, Sandy and Steven. Seeing that they were soundly asleep,
	Jimmy went to the kitchen and turned on the stove's four gas
	burners. He then blew out the flames, leaving only seeping gas
	coming from the dilapidated kitchen appliance.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Moving quickly, Jimmy walked back
	to the rear of the house. The addition was constructed so Steven
	could have a place of his own, secluded from parents and foster
	children. It turned out to be a house of horrors, where Steven
	freely smoked while he committed his perversions. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy took a lighter and lit
	one of Steven's cigarettes. He stood and took a puff, enjoying the
	cigarette and thinking, <I>we're finally free</I>. Feeling a bit
	fuzzy, he took another puff, followed by a long curious look at the
	cigarette. Jimmy then bent and removed another&ndash;victory
	cigarette&ndash;to enjoy later in the day. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Concerned that Jimmy was
	taking too long, Jennette opened the front door and leaned in.
	&quot;Hurry Jimmy!&quot; she yelled. &quot;You need to get out.
	Let's go!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy turned toward the voice
	and then took another puff. &quot;Okay,&quot; he whispered. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He then flinched when
	Jennette yelled, &quot;Now! That's an order!&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm coming!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy bent again. He took
	another puff and then extended his hand next to the curtains, where
	Steven's hand was positioned. Jimmy placed the cigarette between
	Steven's fingers and rested the lit end on the curtain.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hmm, it looks like Steven
	has started a fire.&quot;</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	 <FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hurry!&quot; Janette
	yelled.</FONT></FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;On my way!&quot; Jimmy
	yelled in return. He then quickly darted for the front door of the
	house. Jimmy took hold of Jennette's hand, and the two ran for a
	clearing across the street from the home. They gathered Carrie and
	Conrad and, wagon in hand, moved further down the dirt road. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>The four young warriors were
	safely out of harm's way when the foster home accidentally, yet
	tragically, blew up.</FONT></FONT></DL>
