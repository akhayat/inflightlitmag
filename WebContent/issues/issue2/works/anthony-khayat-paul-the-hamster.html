	<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Like fucking clockwork, my day begins with
	a violent headache.  Wait&mdash;don't tell me&mdash;I've seen this
	one before.  I'm going to wake up next to the fatass I blew last
	night.  Then I'm going to play the most awkward game of hide and
	seek ever with my clothes, and bolt to the nearest IHOP to wash the
	taste of tonight's lucky pervert out of my mouth.  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Ready? Go.  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">With all my might, I thrust my eyelids
	upwards, throwing the invisible weights off of them.  The room isn't
	any lighter than the back of my eyelids, but I do notice, with a
	complete lack of surprise, I'm buck-ass naked.  I also notice, with
	an abundance of surprise, I'm not lying next to anybody.  Or
	anything even.  In fact, I'm not actually in a bed, but sprawled
	supinely on the wooden floor.  A constant squeaking echos in the
	empty room, like the sound of a fan, but I don't feel any air on my
	body.   </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">I stand up, more curious than frightened
	at the change in script.  My hands explore the smooth walls until
	they find a light switch.  I flip it on and the brightness gives me
	a solid smack across the eyes.  After the adjustment period, a plain
	green desk lamp reveals the source of the squeaking&mdash;a brown
	and white ball of fur, incessantly spinning in a wheel in his cage. 
	Instead of the usual upside down water container, someone attached
	an unlabeled medicine bottle to the side.  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">An explosion of loud music coming from my
	left side makes me jump.  I recognize the song&mdash;Tool's
	&quot;Parabola&quot;&mdash;as my ring tone.  I pick the phone up off
	the floor.  It's a private caller.  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Hello?&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;His name is 'Paul'.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Yeah, this is 'Paul'.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;No, the hamster.  I named him
	'Paul'.  After you.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;The fuck?  Is that you Mario?  The
	fuck did you sell me last night?&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;It's Dr. Cain.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Ah.&quot;  I sigh and scratch my
	balls.  &quot;What now?&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;I have terrible news.&quot;</FONT></P><P>
	 
	</P><P> 
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;I know.  You told me yesterday.  I'm
	fucking dying.  Thanks for reminding me.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;No.  It's the hamster.  Do you know
	they only live two or three years on average?&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Of course I know that.  I'm a
	fucking stoner.  I watch the Discovery channel.&quot;  I can still
	hear the squeaking of the hamster wheel, which, combined with this
	stupid conversation, isn't helping my headache at all.</FONT></P><P>
	
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;This one has less.&quot;  He pauses
	expecting a reaction.  When he gets none, he continues.  &quot;He's
	wheeling himself to death. Tragic, really.&quot;   </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;It's a goddamn hamster.  It's not
	even MY goddamn hamster.  What's the problem?  Actually, where did
	you even get him?&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">The voice on the other end is no longer
	Dr. Cain's, but a woman's.  &quot;Hello, is Paul there?  Where's my
	little Paulie?  He's gone!&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Calm down, this is Paul speaking.&quot;
	 </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;You're not a hamster!&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;No shit, lady.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Paul won't talk to me anymore!  I
	wish he'd talk.  If you see him, tell him I'm sorry for yelling at
	him for biting me.  He's not a mean hamster.  I'd hate to see him
	become one of those stupid mean hamsters you see on the news.  The
	ones where they interview those crying moms after they turn up
	dead.&quot;  </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;I'll tell him for you.  What'd you
	say your name was again?&quot;</FONT></P><P>
	
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;I'm sorry, Paulie!  I'm sorry I said
	I didn't want him anymore!  I'm sorry I said I wanted a normal, tan
	hamster instead of an disgusting brown one!&quot;</FONT></P><P>
	
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Jesus, calm down.  I'll tell him,
	but who the hell <I>are</I> you?&quot;</FONT></P><P>
	
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">No answer.    </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Hello? Hello?&quot;  Fuck it.  I
	hang up.  For a while, I sit and watch the other Paul sprint
	fruitlessly in his death wheel, a blank look plastered on his face. 
	I slam my palm into the wall, checking if the noise distracts him. 
	It doesn't.  I eventually get up and open the door, staring at the
	sunny park across the street.   </FONT>
	</P><P>
	</P><P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;Here you go, buddy.&quot;  I open
	the cage, pick up the hamster, and place him facing the park.  As
	soon as I let go, he bolts directly forward.  A speeding Volkswagon
	nearly crushes him on his trek across the street, but he makes it to
	the trees alive.  He'll be dead in a month, I'm sure, but better out
	there than in this shithole, I guess.</FONT></P><P></P><P>
	<FONT FACE="Garamond">As I lose sight of the little bastard, his
	cage disappears, and the park turns into the hallway leading out of
	my bedroom.  I close the door and all my furniture is back.  I grab
	my phone from my nightstand, and it tells me I have a missed call
	from my mother from about twelve minutes ago.  My fingers feel a
	hundred pounds heavier as they move to the call button. </FONT></P>
