	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">The pre-war bibles speak of a coming
	prophecy when Christ Jesus will appear and liberate the chosen
	people; and that the children of Israel - the Jews, will be returned
	to their homeland. The problem with this prophecy is that there may
	not be any Jews left to return. It's alleged that some of them
	escaped to the Middle Eastern deserts, where the oil flows like
	rivers. As the tale is told, the fleeing children of Israel mixed
	with the locals and are hiding as cave dwellers. Hearing of this,
	Hitler erased all traces of the Islamic culture and religion. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	It was also reported that some of the
	Jews hid in Eastern Europe during the war, many of whom fled to
	Mexico and South America, particularly the Andes Mountains, where
	the Nazis were less likely to look. Yet other folks, who bravely
	shared their stories, reported that there are tribes of Jewish
	peoples hiding out in the Alps. And, as I gaze out the window of
	this high-rise hideaway of sorts, I pray that any surviving Jews
	can, one day, return to the land of our Father. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	For miles through this picture window, I
	can see smoke hailing from tall, metal columns. It also bellows from
	chimneys of single-family homes, where unsuspecting families try to
	keep warm from the storm that is upon us. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	There is a momentary break in the dark,
	looming clouds which allows moonlight to sneak through, highlighting
	the color of despair. It seems as if everything created since the
	war ended is made of gunmetal gray, keeping the mood of the people
	forever depressed, thus lessening the likelihood that they would
	rise up against Gestapo rule. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	There is a hint of the color purple in
	some things made for governmental use. I attribute this to Hitler's
	incredibly inflated ego, likening himself to the kings of years ago,
	whose purple garments represented wealth and royalty. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	&quot;Enough of the old,&quot; I whisper,
	and move toward the lone piece of furniture in this
	1500-square-foot-flat. There in the far, darkened corner lay a
	lonely table where my manifesto awaits. &quot;I must keep my spirits
	up.&quot; </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I sit in front of my computer and ponder
	life's meaning, fighting the unfriendly thoughts and images that
	creep into my psyche. I now lay my head in my hands and plea for
	strength. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	With a deep sigh, I consider a
	fantastical thought where children wear bright garments and dance
	freely in abundant fields of wheat. The thought provides me with a
	morsel of solace and allows me to refocus on the mission that is
	about to unfold. For what is soon to transpire, for better or for
	worse, will surely shape the world to come. But, as I prepare to
	send what may be my final decree, I feel an air of unease and a rush
	of adrenaline unlike anything I've ever experienced before. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Is it because I write two versions of
	what may be my final declaration that I feel this trepidation? Or is
	it just the fear that this may be the end for me; or perhaps both?
	Yet, for some unexplained reason, I also feel a dead calm, which
	profoundly contradicts the stated fear.    </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I shrug and to the digital page I
	whisper, &quot;No matter. What is now in motion is only a keystroke
	away. I will send directions to my brethren and, simultaneously,
	bestow my adoration to Susanna, the mother of my two children and
	the one to whom I proclaim my life's love; for they are the reason
	that I lead this million-soldier brigade.&quot;  </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	A distant light moves outside my window,
	distracting me again. It comes from a helicopter that encircles the
	city, no doubt looking for dissidents and curfew violators. The
	thought of secret police hunting down the citizenry causes me to
	wonder what life would be like if the Allied forces had defeated
	Adolph Hitler, the original <SPAN LANG="en">F&uuml;hrer</SPAN>.
	Underground historians seem to believe that the Allied forces,
	mainly US soldiers, came close at the beaches of Normandy. If not
	for a Gothic inspired metal contraption, the world might be a place
	to live and love openly and freely practice the religion of our
	choice. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	A crafty German engineer, however,
	created a metal gate with a hairpin triggering device. It spread for
	miles along the Normandy waterline. When stepped on, the trigger,
	like a bear trap, sprang a small section of the gate to an upright
	position. Within the gate's configuration were thousands of metal
	spikes. Each spike was finely sharpened, and easily penetrated the
	heavy uniforms, as well as the vulnerable flesh of the advancing
	freedom fighters. Like cheap toilet tissue in a torrential downpour,
	the soldiers were ripped to pieces. The first of the rushing storm
	troopers along the fifty-mile stretch of beach, were literally
	shredded. Those directly behind the first wave were then stuck and,
	like fish in a glass tank, easy prey for the hundreds of
	sharp-shooting, Nazi elites. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Then, from behind, the Allied warships
	were surprised, first by aircraft, then by the hundreds of U-boats
	that kept them pinned down and doomed. No one really knows how the
	Germans knew of the attack, or why the original paratroopers, sent
	to clear a path from the beach, never made the correct drop. But,
	the result remains the same: a failed mission that led to Nazi rule.
	</FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I don't think anyone at the time,
	moreover, could have guessed that there was such an insurgence of
	young, Russian men who were covert Aryan supporters. These young
	men, who came to be known as Blitzkrieg Boys, secretly admired and
	celebrated Hitler's attempts at ethnic cleansing. Shortly following
	the Normandy fiasco, the Blitzkrieg Boys defected and became
	warriors for the New Reich. The German army tripled overnight,
	outmanning the Allied forces at every battle. Simultaneously, secret
	ops and high ranking officials within the Blitzkrieg Boys brought
	down the Russian military brass. Soon thereafter, the entire Russian
	government fell to Hitler.</FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond">	The one constant truth about the battles, and
	life since, is that the facts have been skewed. We will never know
	what exactly happened as, officially, the Germans, or should I say
	the government of the New World Order, have re-written our history.
	All I really know is that three times a year we celebrate the great
	victory over the Allied forces. Each holiday extravaganza seems more
	elaborate than the last and always pays homage to Hitler number one,
	Adolph.    </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Thank God that our newest world leader,
	Adrian Hitler, is a narcissist. For it is through his desire to
	conquer all the beautiful women of this vast planet that I can
	create such a war. At a pace of three a day, Adrian yearns to
	fulfill his tenacious libido. In order to accomplish such a task he
	has permitted the Volksweb to spread. It started as a military
	communication vehicle, which turned into a widespread citizen
	friendly message center, allowing computer users around the globe to
	interact. We all knew why it was allowed, but with the help of a
	brilliant Brit, the Volksweb became much more than a messaging tool.
	</FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	In his haste to meet exotic women from
	around the globe, Adrian Hitler accidentally opened a window, or is
	it a portal, where outlaw users could interact and plot. I hesitate,
	however, to call my contemporaries outlaws, as much as we are
	revolutionaries, bound to bring justice to a world that has lacked
	free movement, and speech since 1948.    </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I chuckle at the thought of what Adolph
	would think of his grandson's thoughtless abuse of authority, and
	the reckless use of a web of interconnected fibers, which allows
	information to be shared. For now, the mass information that he,
	Adolph, so diligently fought to keep secret is easily accessed by
	sharp American and British minds. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	The rebellious chatter, kept underground,
	well below the Nazi radar, was just anxious talk&ndash;until
	recently. Though the revolution had started, it wasn't until an
	original copy of the Declaration of Independence was found and
	broadcast throughout the Americas and Britain that it took form. The
	release of our forefathers' document sparked outrage in the US and
	fueled the movement towards a free world. <I>If they did it, so can
	we,</I> became the motto of rebellious Americans. The battle cry was
	then quickly adopted by others: first the British who, without
	hesitation, joined the ranks. Soon to follow were the Canadians,
	Australians, and Nordics. The underground message then quickly
	spread throughout the globe. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	So now, in my orders to you my
	brothers-at-arms, I write: <I>The iron is hot-red and it is, indeed,
	the time to strike. For the date of our original independence, July
	4</I><SUP><I>th</I></SUP><I>, is upon us. So let us now unearth our
	hidden weapons, and rise against the New Order of Oppression that
	has held us hostage, in fear and deception, for all of these years.</I>
	</FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	&quot;Yes,&quot; with a sly smile I
	whisper. &quot;It is time to create new memories and complete the
	dream of Nazi annihilation. With the press of the send key<I>, </I>I
	will unleash the wrath of God upon those of you whose merciless
	souls pass judgment upon the meek and the tribes of Israel.&quot; </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Though it is a dire time, I chuckle
	again. This time I laugh at the irony of the timing for our violent,
	rebellious, actions. It's been rumored that the immature, impetuous
	Hitler is about to impart even more social changes. The State
	newspaper recently reported that Adrian was thinking about letting
	black people participate in World Basketball League; a bold move,
	and one that is unequaled in recent history, since blacks haven't
	participated in organized sports since Jesse Owens defeated the
	Germans in the 1936 Olympics. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Not since Rodolf Hitler, Adolph's
	firstborn son and Adrian's father, allowed Rock and Roll music to go
	mainstream, has there been such an allowance to human dignity. The
	musical movement, known as Rock and Roll, gained mass popularity in
	the late 1950s. It survived in revolving, seedy, underground
	nightclubs in Western Europe and England, as well as the US,
	particularly in the southern states, where it all began.	
	Authorities chased the devil-may-care<I> </I>youth, but it never
	made a difference, for a new musical group would start up at a new
	location as soon as the first group was taken into custody.</FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond">	But it wasn't until the Beatles were
	discovered, playing in the Motherland, that Rodolf took notice. He
	had no choice but to allow the music, since he, himself, was
	hypnotized by the Beatles' allure, and soul-popping backbeat. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	The funniest thing about the evolution of
	rock and roll is that the government leaders never even realized
	that some of the music, much of the music, was a satire of the whole
	regime, beginning with the Stooges then fostered by the Ramones, Sex
	Pistols and Joy Division, whose name even mocked the Third Reich. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	But now, the time is nearing. So to you,
	my sweet, I've written: <I>My love for you extends the bounds of the
	Universe, and is without limit. You raise the sun and lure the
	tides; for without you, my love, there is no light; no love; no
	reason. So, my sweet, if I do not return, please live your life to
	the fullest. Remember me; yet show our children that life continues
	despite loss and trauma. </I></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I hear a noise in the hall and turn from
	the lone light of the monitor. I then hear a knock. &quot;Oh shit!&quot;
	I whisper to the computer keyboard. &quot;They're here. The
	helicopter was for me!&quot; </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	I reach for my gun. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	&quot;I shall eliminate the first
	responders, while I simultaneously launch the epic battles.&quot; </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	The first to go will be the main
	headquarters throughout the world, beginning with the Kremlin and
	the Quantum building in Berlin. Though the New World Order watches
	every person, they didn't count on dissidents leaving devices of
	mass destruction in their own backyard. Nor do they know of the
	million-man army. They do know of me, however, for I have sent out
	many electronic messages to lead them to an army, and a war, that
	does not exist. And, though the imaginary D-day is still a week
	away, they've come for me early. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Before they would come for me, the war
	was supposed to be over, and the world would join China&ndash;the
	last irony&mdash;in freedom from Gestapo rule. The Chinese, who will
	ultimately help in the fight, will soon be the lone world power.
	They were the only nation ignored by Hitler.</FONT><DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond">	The door is kicked open.                     </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	&quot;Die, killers, die,&quot; I shout to
	the SS who've stormed through the door. Bullets fly and my heart's
	beat halts from its thump. </FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond">	Time suspends, images blur. </FONT>
