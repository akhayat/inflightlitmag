	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Pennsylvania morning - the
	orange-blue dawn hangs gently over the world, its empyrean radiance
	echoed by the frost of fall-withered tree and field. A <FONT COLOR="#000000">chilly</FONT>
	autumn breeze shakes the leaves of maple, oak, and mottled birch - a
	frigid jolt to the lungs of the early risers - and a chorus of
	lonesome birds resumes once <FONT COLOR="#000000">more their</FONT>
	morning proclamation of life to dispel the remnants of another
	silent autumn night. Death has <FONT COLOR="#000000">come once more
	to the land &ndash; though some life, as always, persists; eternal
	</FONT>sol gleams above. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>The scene is a solemn thing
	for him. He wakes every morning at 5:30 when the sky is still dark.
	He grinds the coffee beans and loads the drip-brew pot. He cracks an
	egg into one pan, and begins to fry the bacon in another. He opens a
	window to let in the breeze, and breathes deeply the satisfying mix
	of autumn, coffee, and pork &ndash; it is pleasant. His mornings are
	for meditation and relaxation. For him they resonate <FONT COLOR="#000000">with</FONT>
	a sense of peace and stillness, and he likes to drink deep the
	stillness, drink it like a shot of bourbon to quell a nerve. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He sits at the table with a
	mug of hot black coffee in hand, sipping lightly from the steaming
	cup as he observes the morning. He sees through the window the empty
	brown cornfield bordering his own dead lawn, the forest of naked
	trees beyond, and the orange-blue firmament dawning above. It all
	seems to him a gentle, elegant thing mythic in effect, like some
	ancient landscape ripped from the pages of Tolkien. <BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He glances at the ticking
	kitchen clock. 5:57. Sighing, he grabs the plate, fork, spatula, and
	pan and washes them in the sink. He takes his boots from the front
	doormat and, after slipping them on, carefully secures the laces for
	his expedition. He grabs a thick Carhart jacket from its hook by the
	door and steps out into the morning, the cool air enveloping his
	body and enlivening his senses. He breathes in deeply, and exhales a
	breath that turns to fog as it mixes back with the morning air. The
	sound of the clock's march fades to nothing as he closes the door
	and, burying his hands deep into his pockets, he climbs off the
	porch and heads across his brown lawn towards the cornfields. <BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>The house recedes behind him
	as he walks, and he continues the struggle to subdue the shadowy
	thoughts circling the edge of his consciousness &ndash; the
	vulturous awareness of worldly obligations slowly devouring the
	light of his mind. He reproves himself for the severity of his
	thoughts. The fight is a silent protest against the phantoms of a
	world he can't control, and his conviction makes futile the effort.
	He knows too well the realities of life - the necessities of work
	and struggle, the need to survive - and the realities of society &ndash;
	a wage to pay the bills, skills to make the wage, bills to learn the
	trade, caught in a wave reaching ever higher, higher &ndash; and he
	knows that he's but a grain of sand against that tide. <BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>And so he continually pushes
	away these thoughts; never vanquishing, only delaying. Maybe once,
	when he was younger, the fight had seemed worthwhile. But now,
	mid-40s, mortgage halfway paid, college loans a little less, a niche
	nearly carved in a career, he feels that he's fought enough, and if
	he can keep the phantoms at bay one day at a time<FONT COLOR="#000000">;
	</FONT>well, what more can a man do in these times? </FONT></FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, he had some help
	in the struggle. The morning scenes - the cold boreal air filled
	with birdsong, the crunch of frost beneath his feet, the red-dawn
	sun through skeletal trees &ndash; helped to clear, or maybe
	distract, his mind, and he knew what he thought of as a primitive
	peace. <BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>It takes him seven minutes to
	reach the cornfields. He stops briefly at the edge of his lawn and
	looks out. A solitary crow hops into view between rows of
	cornstalks, pecking lightly at the frozen ground in search of a
	meal. The man thinks, <I>I know the feeling</I>, and turns sharply
	left to walk a well-trodden path tracing the edge of the cornfield.
	The path, lined to his left with a row of sturdy shrubs, carries on
	for about four hundred yards alongside of the field at a slow
	incline until it reaches the edge of a forest. He looks everywhere
	but the ground as he walks, taking in the myriad sights and sounds
	of the morning; having taken the same or similar strolls for most
	mornings of his adult life, the path was familiar.</FONT></FONT><DT>
	<BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>As he walks he begins to
	shift his focus more and more from the shadows of his mind to the
	steady rhythm of his feet, the swaying of his arms, and his inward
	and outward breath, heavier now as he picks up his pace on the
	gradually inclining path. Soon, he finds his body and mind coming
	into synch in an almost trance-like state, his whole being pressed
	on by the piston-machinery of his legs towards the tree-edge now two
	hundred feet away. In such moments he finds himself always glaring
	upwards, locking his gaze onto the sun rising above the treetops
	ahead. He feels, in contrast to the cool air, a slight warmth from
	the effulgent orb pressing upon his face, and it's a pleasant,
	inviting feeling. Forgetting almost completely the unwelcome
	inhabitants of his mind, a sense of calm, his &quot;primitive
	peace&quot;, befalls him, and he continues his march towards the
	trees and that life-giver above.</FONT></FONT><DT>
	<BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>With a mere hundred yards
	left to go, he stops and surveys the panorama. Looking back, the
	house he awoke in - the house he'll fall asleep in, the house time
	might trap him in - seems a world away. Likewise, the few cars
	passing by on the road in front of his house were as nothing to him,
	something belonging wholly to a different realm. He had heard them
	absent-mindedly when he first set out but now, marching ever closer
	to the tree line before him, the whir of their passing failed to
	touch his consciousness. They are a symbol of the hours ahead
	marching to meet him &ndash; the drudgery, futility, and frustration
	that surround his days &ndash; and they have no place here, now. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>It always seemed to him that
	as he reached the trees he was somehow approaching a gateway, a
	portal into a place where time could stop, where sol could fix
	itself eternally to heaven's zenith, and his mind could dissolve
	like a raindrop into an ocean into the world around him, and he
	longed with mind, body, and soul for such release.</FONT></FONT><DT>
	<BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>His breathing becomes heavier
	as he reaches the threshold. It's not the result of the climb, but
	the destination; the trees loom before him like countless
	inexplicable monoliths, built in untold eons by unknown hands, each
	one its own incredible mystery. He thinks of Stonehenge. He feels
	like the first explorer to gaze into the eyes of the Sphinx, great
	and terrible, humbled before the mystery of its grandeur. The feel
	of a world too unreal to be the world &ndash; the call of a world
	<I>behind</I> the world &ndash; entices him, the forest as its
	emissary, and he stands at the threshold short of breath, eyes in
	wonder, time forgotten. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He doesn't know what it is
	that calls him &ndash; be it god, death, or something else
	altogether. Perhaps it is some distant echo of childhood hope and
	wild abandon urging him forward into a world where dreams long
	forgotten could bud and bloom again. Perhaps it is some missing part
	of a broken self returning after callous years through the
	still-settling dust of that dream's collision with his seemingly
	inescapable reality; an echo singing candy-corn lies sweet and dark
	as wine. He reels before it and is humbled before it, and he closes
	his eyes, blood like torrents flooding his heart and his head - </FONT></FONT>

	<BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>The trail leads him back the
	way he came, and the door gladly admits him into the house. In less
	than twenty minutes he is showered and dressed. The mirror reveals
	to him a picture of white-color acceptability, and soon his keys are
	in hand. In another few minutes the engine is revved, and a black
	car joins the steadily increasing flow of traffic that winds in
	front of his house. It is 6:55, and his car thunders down to road so
	as not to make him late for work.</FONT></FONT></DL>
