<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
sunk into the cool edge of the pool, the water and April air draping
her in the cool velvet of the night. The water lapped around her
shoulders. The pseudo-jungle in the suburban prairie shuddered in the
dim glow of the outdoor lightbulb. The birds chattered above on the
powerlines, speed-mating in an attempt to fulfill their biological
purpose. Small, tinny sounds of musical lamentations about home and
sex, adventure and love, accompanied the birds out of a speaker. She
could see them waltz against the night sky, silhouetted against the
dark periwinkle curtain of wind; unmarred by the glistening stars
lightyears away. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
clung to the edge of the pool, staring her legs scissoring back and
forth under the liquid haze of the chlorinated pool. Her thighs and
toes bobbed through the bright blue water. Her back faced the house,
she instead stared at the created outcropping of rock and the
not-quite-native palm trees.  She watched as she watched the bird, in
the half seconds before she blinked, the manifestations of her
anxiety seemed to dance with the birds. Anxiety was a prisoner from
an old film who rattled a tin cup against cell bars, begging,
screaming, and wailing for attention. He screamed about her body, the
only thing she felt like she could have complete control over,
telling her she was sick, everything on her was falling apart into
rapid old age. That she was going to become a burden on those around
her; that she would run out of time before her time even began. The
only way to momentarily pacify him was to go to the doctor, an
expensive coping mechanism that left her chewing her thumbnail in
waiting rooms contemplating how to save every cent. And even then it
did not always help, her trust of doctors had been poisoned by the
media in a way that had no antidote. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
the anxiety did not only manifest in the form of copays and
prescriptions. He also came in all the forms of the
quarter-life-crisis; every authority figure who ever expected
something of her, the boy who she had given everything to and still
left her with the sour taste of swallowed sobs in her mouth, and
friends who seemed indifferent at best. She even saw her potential
future, a former low-grade whizkid turned pinnacle of middle class
mediocrity. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
she watched her body under the water, she could not help but feel
disconnected from it, like it was someone else’s entirely that she
was borrowing, a bodysnatcher in her own right with shitty luck. Even
at that, she felt guilty about her self-indulgent sadness. Everyone
her age seemed to have similar feelings, masked behind the sunny
Instagram posts—a universal sense that their world was burning
around her and she was holding the lighter. Her head sunk into the
water before the tears could ripple the pool’s surface. Everything
became muffled in the sanctity of the chlorine. She wondered how long
she could stay there. She wondered who would drown first, her or her
sadness. </font></font>
