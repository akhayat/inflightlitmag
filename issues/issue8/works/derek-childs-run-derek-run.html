<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Being
alone isn’t all bad. I repeated this like a mantra. On a plus side,
I could fart whenever I wanted – great long gusts of wind, capable
of impaling passersby. At the same time though, I couldn’t escape
the feeling that a hole, reserved only for a paramour, existed inside
my heart, and until I found that special woman, I’d always feel
incomplete. </font></font>

<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Experiencing
the absence of another’s affection meant that I seemingly
masturbated more often than I believed was normal. Sometimes, even in
public, the urge would creep up, however, I imagine someone would
take umbrage if I flopped out my penis on the train. Though crowds of
cheering fans watched an orangutan beat off at the zoo, I hardly
believe that kind of reception would have greeted me. Instead, I’d
be on the news: the chronic masturbator: </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Considering
at least half the world is made up of women, getting a date shouldn’t
be too hard, yet, from the moment I was 18, I have depressingly
accepted the possibility of unending loneliness. Many of the women
I’ve attempted relations with, though initially intrigued,
eventually conceived excuses, after indefinitely avoiding me:</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>My
sisters have each dated bad men. I’ve never dated anyone, but I can
tell with one look, you are a bad man, too.</i></font></font></div><br>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I’m
sorry; my boyfriend won’t allow me to see other men.</i></font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>You
remind me so much of my ex. I think I’m going to sleep with him
tonight.</i></font></font></div><br>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
can’t talk to you right now – I’m sick. I plan on being sick
for a VERY long time.</i></font></font></div><br>

stars are not aligned, and even if they were, I would travel into
space and misalign them.</i></font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Despite
my resolve to continue searching, I couldn’t help but wonder,
considering my history, <i>what’s the point to it all?</i></font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Such
gruesome thoughts had never once entered the mind of Katarina
Tchakova (pronounced cha-cove-are), an international student I was
later introduced to. When friends asked how I ever managed to meet a
woman, who, despite our shared inability to find work in the
industries we were trained for, was so different from myself. Many
argued, <i>no Derek, that couldn’t have been what happened</i>.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Mark,
my room-mate, had often commented on how tense I was. Between
university and employment, I had limited <i>me</i> time, the
obviousness of this apparently written all over my face. <i>There’s
a service I sometimes use</i> he told me. <i>It does have a bit of a
stigma attached to it, so if you do, I wouldn’t necessarily scream
it from the rooftops</i>. </font></font>
</div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
initially didn’t take him seriously. Mark was so full of shit;
literally, alongside figuratively. He defecated at least four times a
day, the sound of the toilet screaming through the walls. The toilets
of friends and acquaintances ran silent, a soothing <i>whoosh</i>
accompanying an excretion. When we rented an apartment together, it
was the dreaded phantom flush:
<i>Whooooooaaaaaarrrrrreeeeeeerrrrrrrssssshhh!</i> At night, I would
sometimes awake, the sound tearing through the walls, and wonder, <i>was
it a nightmare – no, it was a toilet</i>.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
the other hand, Mark was a little strange, for two reasons. The first
was his grandmother, who came by on a daily basis. Back in Chengdu,
she was heralded as a witch-doctor, using natural herbs to clear
people of infection. When I was sick, she tossed me a small bag of
what looked like sugar. <i>Clean you right up it will</i> she beamed
as I shrugged my shoulders and engulfed the foul-smelling contents.
<i>What is this stuff?</i> I asked. <i>My special recipe</i> she
replied; <i>crushed Killer Whale penis</i>! Safe to say, I never ate
anything she handed me again.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Moreover,
the second reason was, of all people, Mark was living with me. Few
individuals would allow a professional streaker into their lives. Not
only was there the humiliation attached to the role (for the money I
was receiving, I was happy to show off my arse), there was also the
danger. Whenever I came home, the first thing I would do, was look
outside – where many people might admire the view, I observed the
adjacent rooftops for potential snipers, the number of death threats
I had received guaranteeing I would be in some assassin’s
iron-sights one day.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Moreover,
finding a job in my line of work was seldom easy. They didn’t
advertise these gigs in the paper, and usually it was word of mouth
that led employers to contact me. Normally it was lawyers, unionists
or revolutionary movements who wanted my services, in order to send a
third party message. They were often confused when someone with my
qualifications arrived at their door.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Though
I had three and a half degrees, majoring in both writing and
teaching, finding a job was the hard part.<br><br>‘Are you feeling
alright son?’ employers would often ask.<br><br>Usually I’d have
some witticism prepared. ‘Oh, don’t worry – I’ll be fine.
After this I’m gonna go home and suck on some Killer Whale
penis.’<br><br>The responses however, were occasionally even more
peculiar. ‘Of course you are. I did the same thing last night.’</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">My
first real job (not including my stint as a model, or my role as a
salesman in my parents’ short-lived business) was in the fresh food
department at Coles. In our neighbourhood, people would rarely look
at you, let alone use words.  After I joined the crew of the
supermarket chain, all of that changed. Total strangers would come up
to my mother and congratulate her on my efficiency, politeness and
charm. </font></font><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Apparently,
my presence had changed their experience for the better. Where once
patrons had difficulty trying to find fresh produce amongst all of
the shrivelled, mouldy fruits and vegetables, which resembled
Tutankhamen’s mummified testicles, now, their trips to the
supermarket were a joy.  In contrast with all of my achievements, I
think this was the one time my mother was most proud of me. Clearly,
I was destined for great things…</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
…<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Then
I became a writer. Though the university degree I had undertaken had
the word <i>professional</i> in its title, it might as well have
contained the word <i>shit-covered-pubic-hair</i>. After the fiasco
with Coles’ shares, many employees, including myself, were let go.
Though my mother presumed I would find work, becoming a writer, meant
only one thing: <i>unemployment benefits</i>.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Besides,
I couldn’t sink any further in the eyes of my parents. My father
always had a temper. From lumps in the potato, to liquid detergent
stains on his shirt, the simplest of things could set him off.
Looking at me must have been a real pain in the arse for him. He
never wanted a child, and he made sure I knew this on a daily basis.
I learned early on, I was a product of my father running out of
condoms. <i>If only I’d found a rubber, this mistake would not have
happened!</i> </font></font><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
drinking heavily (which happened most days), he’d confess other
truths, the most prominent being his desire for me to commit suicide.
The addendum I suffered depression and anxiety only infuriated him
further. <i>You are an embarrassment to me! You’re not a man, you
pathetic piece of shit! </i>Of course, once sober, he’d
conveniently forget, and any attempt to remind him would result in a
series of threats. <i>This is my fucking house! I’ll say and do
whatever the fuck I like! You don’t like it, LEAVE! </i>By the time
I was 12, I’d heard this threat so many times, it had essentially
lost all meaning. However, it often included <i>cunt</i>, his
favourite word. I had to check my birth certificate more than once –
he called me this so frequently, I half expected it to be my
birth-name.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All
of this aside, it took only a week before my inquisitiveness won out.
Once this happened, I called the number Mark had provided and
requested a private evening session in a hotel suite.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
room wasn’t anything fancy; a murky green floor, with white
furniture and a kitchenette, in which hardly anything worked. The
light only marginally improved the gloominess of the room, though
Katarina, upon her arrival, made it so much brighter. Her glimmering
eyes were as black as her hair, which drifted across her back, her
facial features aligning in perfect symmetry. She was dressed in a
long black cloak, the sound her heels made as they hit the floor
reverberating everywhere as she strolled into the bathroom as though
she were the one who had ordered the suite. Instructing me to wait,
she closed the door in my face, while I was left scratching my head,
wondering if this were how the evening was meant to begin.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Before
an answer could come to mind, the door was flung open, Katarina
presenting herself in a tight, latex suit, which squeaked with every
step she took. It was an incredible orange colour, the white stripes
along the sides matching her shimmering boots. She slapped a whip in
her hand, my voice becoming lodged in my throat. ‘Your clothes,’
she said, ‘remove them.’</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
stepped aside as I made my way into the bathroom, Katarina slapping
me across the back of the leg. ‘Faster.’ I carefully removed my
garments, however, another hit caused me to hurriedly toss them into
the corner, until I was sitting naked on my knees in front of her. I
placed an orange mask that had been left for me over my head, only my
eyes being visible.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Katarina
rested herself against the basin, lighting a cigarette. ‘Orange is
my colour – it’s strong, bright, easy to remember. You are
wearing it now, and that makes you my property. You are mine to do
with what I will. What shall I do to you this evening?’ She blew a
ring of smoke into the air.<br><br>‘Ms Tchakova, I have been a
wretched young man. I want you to punish me.’<br><br>‘Recite me
back the rules for this evening.’ She had an <i>I don’t give a
shit</i> kind of attitude, yet still maintained her professionalism
throughout.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
bowed my head in front of her. ‘I will do whatever you
command.’<br><br>‘Who is this <i>you</i> that you speak of?’
She thrust her boot atop my head, pushing my forehead onto the cold
tiles.<br><br>‘Ms Tchakova. I will do whatever Ms Tchakova
commands.’<br><br>‘Good boy. Continue.’<br><br>‘Failure to
comply with Ms Tchakova’s demands will result in punishment.’</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
blank piece of paper suddenly fluttered down in front of me, Katarina
placing a pen at my side. ‘Write my name.’</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
hurriedly scrawled her name onto the paper: <i>Katarina Tchakova</i></font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
peered over my shoulder at my writing. ‘My name requires more loops
than that.’<br><br>She kicked me in the buttocks with her heel,
before tossing her whip aside, and picking up another that resembled
a cat o’ nine tails. ‘Bend over. You will receive twenty lashes.
Start counting.’<br><br>I did as instructed, Katarina slapping it
against my arse. The jolt caused me to grunt with both pain and
excitement as she did it again. After a few extra hits she paused.
‘How many times have I hit you?’<br><br>‘Six.’<br><br>She
kicked me. ‘Seven stupid! You will now receive fifty lashes.’ She
hit me again, my heart a flutter, as I clenched my hands into fists,
expecting the next hit. I’d initially imagined I might feel
embarrassed to participate as a victim while a woman dominated me,
however, I could literally feel the tension flowing away with every
hit. Katarina stood beside me, running her nails across my back. My
entire body quivered, a sigh erupting out of me as she dug her nails
into my flesh, a burst of pain and pleasure flooding through me as
she spanked me with the whip again.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
session didn’t feel like 110 minutes. Placing her whip upon my
shoulder, Katarina requested I fulfil an online survey, commenting on
my experience. After what I’d been through – I only had good
things to say, as I watched her apply the black cloak over her latex
uniform. I was unsure how to end the evening as I handed her back the
mask.<br><br>‘Keep it,’ she purred, ‘you’re mine now.’</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Seeing
Katarina once a fortnight became a habit of mine from that moment
onwards, each time there being a particular task she wanted me to
accomplish. On one evening, it was reading a letter a friend had sent
her in perfect Russian. </font></font><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Bilingualism
had never been a strong-suit of mine. On forms that asked <i>what
languages can you speak</i>, I pondered if Bad English constituted, a
bit like when a sheet asked <i>sex: male/female</i>, and I thought of
instead answering <i>yes please</i>. </font></font>
</div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
having to undertake Italian in high-school, I remember my teacher
perfectly announcing i<i>l ficiamo</i>, requesting every student to
individually recite it. <i>Ill-fuck-i-ma</i> I repeated.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">My
inability to perform to her expectations resulted in the whip being
slapped across my arse some more. Despite having been as equally
naked in my personal life as I was in my professional, there was
something astonishingly beautiful about the experiences I shared with
Katarina. This, of course, was just her stage name, her birth-name
being Ophelia. It was potentially irresponsible of her to share this
information with me, however, after the many intimate evenings we
shared, I for one couldn’t help the feelings that began to manifest
in my heart.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
I finally did ask her out after a session together, she slapped me
across the back of the leg with her cat o’ nine tails.<br><br>‘What
did you just ask me?’<br><br>I bowed my head. ‘I beg of you Ms
Tchakova. Allow me to take you out on a date.’<br><br>She spanked
me with her whip. ‘Where in the rules does it say you have the
right to exclusivity?’<br><br>‘It doesn’t Ms Tchakova.’<br><br>‘Then
why ask?’<br><br>‘I want you.’<br><br>She spanked me again.<br><br>‘I
mean, I want you Ms Tchakova.’<br><br>She spanked me again.<br><br>‘I
want you and only you Ms Tchakova!’<br><br>Again, she spanked me,
bending down to face me before I had the opportunity to speak once
more. Placing her hand on my chin, she raised my head, grabbing the
sides of my mouth and forcing my lips onto hers. She parted her lips,
and I inserted my tongue into the moist surfaces of her mouth.<br><br>She
dug her nails into the flesh of my buttocks. ‘When did I give you
permission to do that?’<br><br>‘You didn’t; I took the
initiative.’<br><br>‘I like that,’ she said, kissing me again.
‘I normally don’t let men get this close. I don’t like them
seeing my wrinkles.’<br><br>‘I can’t see any.’<br><br>‘Sweet-talker,’
she said between breaths as we continued to passionately join lips. I
moved my hands around her, grabbing hold of her firm buttocks, her
suit squeaking between my fingers.<br><br>‘When can I see you
again?’ I asked.<br><br>‘When would you like to see me
again?’<br><br>‘Tomorrow night.’<br><br>She slapped my leg.
‘Busy.’<br><br>‘The night after.’<br><br>She smiled, biting
my lower lip, before running her tongue across my face, from my lips,
to the bridge of my nose, just as the door to the hotel room was
suddenly kicked in, a collection of armed police officers storming
inside. They looked from Katarina in her uniform, to myself, in my
current state of undress. ‘Ha, caught in the act you vile beast!’
roared the officer in front.<br>With a towel wrapped around my
genitals, I was led out of the hotel in handcuffs, Katarina not far
behind.</font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 115%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
the police station, I found myself locked inside an interview room,
darker than the depths of Hell. Just as my eyes had adjusted, burning
lights exploded around me, and the officer who had arrested me
strutted inside, throwing a file that was bigger than my head onto
the desk. He wore a suit that looked to be a distant cousin to the
one I wore that evening when I saw Katarina.<br><br>‘Mr Childs, I
thought it might please you to know, we recently released Ms. Ma. She
wanted me to remind you about your date; however, you have much
bigger problems than that. We have placed you at a number of events
in which you have purposefully disturbed the peace.’ He sneezed,
wiping his mouth on his sleeve. ‘Damn, I must be getting a cold.
Anyway, do you have anything to say for yourself?’ he asked.<br><br>I
smiled. ‘Perhaps you should suck on some Killer Whale penis.’</font></font></div>
