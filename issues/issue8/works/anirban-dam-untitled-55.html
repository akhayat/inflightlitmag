most days, there’s too much stillness lurking beneath these
dialogues, but I am finally learning to fathom each pause, decipher
each wrinkle in your tone, count every freckle on your breath but
this rigidity under my tongue still manages to stifle me at times,
yet your name echoes between a voice and a verb like an action
unaware of its consequence. and maybe there’s a reason why your
words keep missing the mark by a split second, maybe there’s a
reason why my hindsight keeps hiding in my back pocket right next to
the spare change; perhaps there’s adequate menace in our mouths to
paint the night into something so perverse that our limbs might
tremble at the very thought of dawn.</font></font></div>
