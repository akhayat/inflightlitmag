<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
reminisce and I remember about the time<br>when I would listen to the
rhythm<br>of poetic brilliance, before accepting the title of <i>poet</i>.<br>I
would sit beside the ghosts<br>of Charles Olson, Ezra Pound, William
Carlos Williams<br>and Allen Ginsberg, and together,<br>we would
constantly critique, between sighs and laughs,<br>the creation of
others, amidst the appreciation of the audience.<br>We would
contemplate the potential corrections<br>that could enrich the echoes
of internal emotion,<br>tied to the function and the metre of the
line,<br>in order to better perform the deliverance of words<br>written
out of our consciousness.<br>But, having now perhaps poisoned the
future<br>of my endeavour's outcomes, by branding my material<br>with
the unanimous packaging of poetic licence,<br>much like the works I
used to contemplate,<br>I have become a target for critical, academic
observants,<br>keen to sink their new found teeth<br>into the
material of imaginative woe.<br>Little do they know about the
challenges faced<br>by the ink I use, and now that those memories
have been erased,<br>I must become an armadillo, to fend myself<br>from
the ever constant complaints<br>regarding how my work is not
<i>contemporary</i>.<br>Besides, what is the definition of that
word?<br>As I struggle to find an answer,<br>I look behind me, as if
expecting to see<br>my younger self, perhaps even in black and
white,<br>to accentuate the ancientness of the unwanted warning<br>which
falls from between my teeth, forbidding me<br>from taking the classes
of multiple professors,<br>who dared to desecrate my lines with such
villainy.<br>Clearly it never worked. (Pause for dramatic effect).<br>If
attempting to summarise contemporary issues,<br>could it be done with
the following few dozen words?<br>Miley Cyrus, same sex marriage,
Schappelle Corby,<br>Syria, dancing Joe Hockey, oil, the Avengers,
MySpace <br>(does it still exist?), people smuggling, ISIS, global
warming, <br>Barack Obama, NBN (or lack thereof). Google, police
<br>corruption, teacher strikes, hacking, Centrelink, <br>nude photo
scandal, North Korea, say it with a hashtag. <br>Team Australia,
gangland violence, selfies, <br>cat pictures, Asa Akira - the sex
goddess <br>of adult media, king hit punch, Destiny 2<br>will
probably suck, economics, alcoholism, <br>the prophet Mohammad,
pandas in captivity. <br>Microsoft, video piracy, Photoshop, Star
Wars, <br>cyber bullying, drug addiction, animal cruelty,
Date-A-Live, <br>raising the terror level - come to think of it,
<br>Park Choa’s blonde hair is more newsworthy than that<br>(and
far sexier). Refugees, education, Facebook,<br>sharks invading our
beaches (in ten years time <br>there’ll be no sharks left, so
please, <br>enjoy this douchebag of an expression).<br>Turnbull
government clichés, terrorism, the environment, <br>the Wachowski
sisters, education, university, <br>is the Earth still flat, or have
we solved that one already? <br>Halo 5, nuclear energy, Clive Palmer,
extremism, <br>endangered species, artificial intelligence, Birdman,
<br>Inside Out, Christianity, Lollipop, non-binary bathrooms, <br>global
warming, mental health, equal wages, yeah, you get the point. <br>Do
any of these constitute our contemporary world? </font></font>
