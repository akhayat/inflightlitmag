<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
was in the Spring of 1972 that the newly married Mr and Mrs Bridges
moved into their California apartment. It was a modest, modern place
in an unassuming three story block. Within a week they had met and
been made welcome by each of the tenants. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
were riding the bus to the supermarket when one of these tenants - a
man whose height and stature might have made him seem imposing were
it not for his warmth and intelligence - got on the bus also.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
waved to him from where they were sitting and he sat on the seat
behind them, placed the bowling ball bag he was carrying down next to
him. The Bridges turned and chatted with him a while until he said
that this was his stop and he looked forward to seeing them around
soon.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
this was written with the intention that it be read somewhere public.
In fact, it should be read on the bus.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
is a story about perspective. Of your own and of others'. And it
ought to be read on the bus.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Not
at home. There you can read anything you want without impeachment.
Without the paranoia that someone might be wondering what you're
reading. Without the fantasy that someone might be reading over your
shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Not
on the train either. On the train no-one cares that you're reading.
The Tube likewise; on the tube no-one cares. The train and the Tube,
they're impersonal. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
the beer garden, even that won't do. Despite the gin-nosed drunk
asking, despite the staggering divorcee insisting, no-one cares what
you're reading there either.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
the bus, of course, no-one cares either. But on the bus there is a
chance that perhaps they might. On the bus, at least, you can think
that they might. You can even think that they do. There is space for
it in the gaps where hot breath is shared. These gaps on trains are
too wide, these gaps on the tube too ignored; lost amongst the
constant changing and rearranging of the carriage's contents. These
gaps in the beer garden are clouded with smoke and desperation.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
are all impersonal and so there is no potential for anything personal
to be violated. A secret shared on the train, on the Tube, in the
beer garden, it remains secret. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
the bus, the bus is intimate claustrophobia. They say that school
prepares you for work. No. School prepares you for the bus. Trapped
amongst peers of disparate interests. Shoulder to shoulder. Breathing
in each other's breath. Stepping on each other's feet. Waiting,
avoiding eye contact and conversation, until you can leave.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
constant, consistent half-dry half-wet wailing of a baby. Weaving
through all levels of consciousness. The dragging sound of its misery
unstopping, like an air raid siren organ-grinder. The plastic sheet
covering its pram steamed up. Is its mother, sitting beside it,
ashamed of it I wonder. Or does she think, as I suspect, that
everyone will ignore it the way she has trained herself to. She
ignores it and it goes ignored by the world - that is her thinking.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
woman in front, her auburn hair is tied back tight. At the hairline
penny-circles of red where the skin's been scratched away. And behind
her ear, in the crease there, blood clotted brown. If you have ever
cultivated lice on your own scalp you know these lesions by touch.
Sticky wet, plasmic. Is she ashamed of her hardbacked redbellied
passengers, I wonder. Or does she think, as I suspect, that no-one
will notice. She ignores them and so they go ignored by the world -
that is her thinking. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Or
perhaps the mother knows to ignore the screaming baby because it is
right to be screaming. Perhaps the woman doesn't ignore her lice, but
loves them.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Who
am I to say. You can decide for yourself.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
the bus, where a man might look at me and I at him and he believes we
have made eye contact. He has no idea that I'm taking aim. I know I'm
no good in a fight; I lack both technique and toughness. But I have a
strong grip and I keep my thumbnails long and sharpened to points.
You never know who might have ideas on your wallet. It's a very thin
film that separates us from the world. A very thin film, stretched
very tight. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There's
a story they tell of me at the hostel. A joke or a legend or perhaps
both. I once fought a man with a glass eye. Pushed it so far back
that he choked on it. So the legend goes. So the joke goes.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
don't know whether to tell you that my thumbs have never once touched
the whites of a man's eyes, or whether to tell you that they're
drenched in the goo of a thousand. I feel I should tell you one or
the other, so let us compromise: I'll tell you both and you can
choose which to believe.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Of
course, I can't make you take this onto the bus. I can no more
control this than I can control the whims of a cat or the temperature
of the wind.  I could ask, of course, and I'm asking now. I'm not
above begging, and I am begging you now. I'm embarrassing myself to
all those who took my authorship as authority and who sit now on the
bus reading these words that aren't for them while you sit at home or
on the train or in the beer garden or somewhere else waiting for me
to get back to Edmund and the newlyweds.</font></font></p>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Well,
ok. If you're not on the bus now, after my explaining and my asking
and my begging, then there's nothing else I can do to get you on
there. </font></font>

was the Spring of 1972 and Edmund Kemper had murdered, butchered,
cannibalised and desecrated eight female college students in as many
years. Of his most recent victim, he had sawn off the head and zipped
it inside his bowling ball bag, intending to take it somewhere quiet
and secluded so he could sit and hold it, look at it and talk to it.</font></font></p>
