I to describe it as gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe that I
couldn’t scrape off, would you say I should be grateful it not
quicksand?  How about on the days it is wet concrete and I get stuck?</font></font></div>

this normal?  Can it be fluid?  Is anxiety like weight?  Is there a
target range I should aim for?  A chart telling me I’m okay?  Or is
my just being here a tipped scale?</font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Where
did you get your degree?  What was the application process like? 
Were you carefully selected?  Did you get all A’s, or the
occasional B, even a C?  Can I admit knowing your GPA wasn’t
perfect would make me more comfortable?  Is that framed thing hanging
on your wall there the ceremonial paper they handed you the day you
graduated, or the official diploma sent out months later?  Did you
grow eager for it, checking the mailbox day after day as though you
were waiting on a pair of X-Ray vision glasses? You know the ones,
right, the kind offered in old comic book novelty ads and guaranteed
to work?  Did you believe in their magical science, or doubt?</font></font></div>

you going to ask me about my childhood?  My parents?  Could we please
save them for another time?  Is that an unrealistic request; am I
being too difficult?  Would it be all right if today you just taught
me to fold anxiety into a less threatening beast—an origami tiger,
perhaps?  How do I contort my fingers around its size, manage its
gnarled shape?  Do you think I should be on medication?  I’ve heard
meds make you feel as though something alien has infested your brain,
rewriting your thoughts with its own chemistry; is any of this true? 
Have you seen <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>?  Did you know
there’s a fungus that enslaves ants and other insects with
mind-control, killing them when they reach an ideal spot for its
spores to spread—growing outwards from the inside of its host like
a nightmare tree?  </font></font>

we explore other options first?  Behavioral reconditioning? 
Controlled breathing techniques or meditation?  How about a
posthypnotic suggestion?  Is that a real thing?</font></font></div>

you ever been on this side of the couch?  Was it easy because you
knew what to say?  What if my answers aren’t good enough or <i>too</i>
crazy?  If I were to make something up or keep something hidden,
could you tell?  Do people do that often here?  Are you trained to
spot a liar, to read shifty body language the way hardboiled cops do
when trying to crack a perp?  You’re not going to shine some low
hanging ceiling light in my eyes, are you?  </font></font>

that jumbo-sized box of Kleenex for when I cry, or do you just have a
really bad cold?  Do patients cry?  If I don’t, will it mean there

questions, how they itch and tingle under my tongue like an allergic
reaction, a usual sensation before our getting started?  </font></font>
