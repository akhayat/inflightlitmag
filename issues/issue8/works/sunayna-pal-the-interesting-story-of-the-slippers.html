am the vehicle of the poor and the vacationing comfort of the rich.
Amusingly, I didn't fall in either of the categories. I landed on the
soft feet of a very gentle and wise man. He used me with care inside
the house. His wife was a neat freak and didn't allow me outside the
house, ever. Their house was my whole world, I don't know what the
outside held for me but I wanted to feel the tickle of the green
grass, the cold of the asphalt or so many textures and feelings that
I didn't even know existed. Other than this complaint,  life was
comfortable. He used me with care. I was the first thing he looked
for after coming home. He had many shoes and boots for outside wear
but I was the only one he wore indoors.</font></font></font></div><br>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One
day, something terrible happened. It was a Wednesday I will never
forget. It started as routine but in the evening, He broke me. It was
so sudden that I hurt. He almost stumbled too. That was the worst day
of my life. As gently as he had used me, he kept me on the side of
the door. For three days, I patiently sat. He looked at me but didn't
touch me. He used his socks instead of me. This was going to be the
end of me or so I thought. Thankfully, on the weekend, he took me to
the cobbler. and got me repaired. I thought he was going to throw me
away but I got my life back. He used me as lovingly as ever and I was
glad.</font></font></font></div><br>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Good
things don't last long and well, just after a few weeks, I broke
again. It didn't hurt as much as it had the first time but I realized
that my joints were old now. <br><br>&quot;Just throw them away and
get new ones&quot; reprimanded his wife.<br><br>He thought it was a
good option too as it took a lot of his time and effort to repair me.
I was sad. I didn't know what to do or say to her. I was very angry.
I don't think that she ever liked me.</font></font></font></div><br>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
kept me at the bottom of their shoe cabinet. I don't think that he
was ready to let me go. Maybe he would repair me again. I stayed in
the darkness for a long time, unaware of the days changing outside. I
don't know how he was surviving without me but It was a difficult
time for me. There were others to talk to but they all had the same
story and wanted to roam around. There was one respite. Many of them
have been outside the door. Though they were miserable as me for not
being used, they told me interesting stories of the world outside.
Few had been in the car and driven with him. Some had been to his
office and told me of the friends they made there. A few told me
horror stories of poop and spit. Everything about the outside
fascinated me and I prayed for a way out of this darkness.<br><br>One
day, there was a party. Though they lived in a very clean house but
his wife took extra care when there were people over. I saw him keep
another set of slippers in the cabinet and take out his party boots.
I saw the new slippers. They weren't gray and blue like me, they were
black in color with something written in green. They were thicker
than me and seemed more comfortable. I had never been so jealous in
my life. The new ones stayed in the cabinet for the full night. The
new slipper seemed nice and by the end of the night, I had forgotten
that they were my replacements. I was glad that he was comfortable
but what was going to happen to me?</font></font></font></div>

the morning, she saw me. <br><br>Disgusted, she asked him &quot;Why
are your old slippers still here. Didn't you buy new ones?&quot;<br></font></font></font><br>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br>It
seems that it was their farewell party. They were to leave this
house. I used to be aware of the things happening in his life when I
was with him but now, this was so sudden. Without any good bye or any
time to prepare, he picked me and kept me out of the door. She looked
pleased. She looked at me and said &quot;May it go to someone in
need&quot;<br><br>I had never been so miserable. I just sat there on
the road outside their house. There was no fan outside and the sun
kept rising. I didn't believe it was possible to be rescued as her
prayer suggested. I stayed there till afternoon but it did happen. A
homeless guy was wandering through the road and saw me outside the
house. He picked me up with joy. He saw that I was broken but the joy
didn't leave his face. He kept me in his cotton bag and turned around
and walked.</font></font></font></div><br>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
just so happened that he had asked the cobbler for some slippers.
Sadly the kind cobbler didn't have any to spare but he told the poor
man that if he could get a slipper that could be repaired, he would
do it for free. Just after that, he saw me and ... well I am glad
that her intention worked.</font></font></font></div><br>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
didn't believe in intentions working but I am so glad that it worked
and well, I am so grateful for this man, I am now seeing and going
places. I like my life again. It is a welcome change from the
darkness. Though I wish he didn't walk so much, I like the fresh air
and the warm sun and the new things I see.</font></font></font></div>
