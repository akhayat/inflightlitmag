<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
I was young, I encountered God in the form of a question, but I
didn’t answer. So I spent my life calling him back. Pray the
rosary. Count ten beads. Repeat. Count ten tears. [Dear reader,
insert what comes next.] I’ve been in the hospital every year since
2007. That year I cradled my premature baby in my palm. She opened
and closed her fingers as if saying goodbye before she died. Suzanne,
our nurse, said the baby’s lungs are too tiny and there’s nothing
they can do. White linens soaked up my blood. She said I was pale
like snow. 28th Street Elementary girls told me I couldn’t be a
“queen” because my parents weren’t Mexican even though I
watched <i>Carrusel</i>, the Mexican novela, just like they did, and
I wished I was blonde, blue-eyed like our favorite character Maria
Joaquina. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
like the same things I like, I told them. But they said my skin
wasn’t white enough. But I had a solution: I ate rose petals, the
red and white speckled ones growing in front of our boarding house,
convinced they’d make me beautiful. Red is my favorite color like
blood, bricks, creamy red lipstick that smells of honey, and roses
that grow from unmarked graves. We lived in South Central until I was
ten. I helped my mother throw away the dead mice caught between the
floorboards. </font></font>

“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">La
siguanaba is here!” I’d yell chasing after my brother and sister
with my long, shiny black hair over my face. We’d run away laughing
and crying. I sprinkle salads with lavender and calendula. [Insert my
fears, your fears, here.] My mother, while cleaning, played her
favorite love songs by Marco Antonio Solis. We thought he was Jesus.</font></font></p>

calms me like an all white room, like a white, cozy sweater smeared
with red lipstick on days that feel like my bronchial tubes will
tighten in Soprano 1 until my chest bursts. Fireworks are pretty. My
sister played the violin when she was a little girl. Her long, black
hair fell over her face as she carefully opened the case, took the
violin out, and with a cloth cleaned it as if she were washing the
face of the man she loves. Her teacher scolded her: “That’s not
how you play.” My sister over tuned the strings. They snapped.<i>
</i>She willingly checked herself into a mental institution in Texas
for a few days to get away “from everything.” She was surrounded
by clear December ice. </font></font>

comb your thick hair falling to your waist, and tell you everything
will be okay. You never liked hair buns and braids because they were
always too tight. We could pretend we’re little girls again. We
could lie silent in bed staring at the moon wondering what it’s
like to be queens. Then, I’d collect your tears in recycled jam
jars and throw them in the lake</i>.</font></font></p>

I’m stressed, I listen to Yo Yo Ma’s prelude from Bach´s Cello
Suite No. 1. It makes me want to crawl under a mountain of yellow
leaves and hibernate. My inner clockwork is busted. Fix me. Wind me
up like a wooden doll. I want coffee with Bailey’s before my 7 p.m.
class. But I already drank a venti Americano in the morning. The lady
next to me in the coffee shop says I must be stressed. She eyeballs
my bag, an anniversary present, with suspicion. “What could you
possibly be stressed about?” she asks. “You’re not playing the
game of life right.” </font></font>

Yo Yo Ma ever snap a string? My mother had nightmares of guerillas

day, I wash my face in a circular motion. I brush my teeth, clean the
wax in my ears, pluck unwanted hair. I perform these ablutions
convinced Emily Dickinson was on to something. I want to fold into
myself. Crease my limbs. Make me a graceful origami crane. My father
lives off coffee and cigarettes. He’s a trucker and never gets
sick. A six-foot cholo threatened my five-foot-five father with a
gun. The bullet burst through the Pacoima house’s wall, past my
head. </font></font>

threw myself on the carpet and thought of the time my father taught
me how to say “world” in English. My six-year-old tongue curled,
and I said “worm” instead. We both laughed. And when he came in
the house, he stood while we were all on the floor. His ear covered
in blood. The cholo jumped in his getaway car as soon as my father
took his gun. &quot;No me convenía morir,” he had told me a few
years ago when I asked him what had happened. It wasn’t convenient
to die, he said. Count the many ways I love you, the ways I’ve let
you down, am letting you down, will let you down.	</font></font></p>

a hospital bed in 2007, my heart pounded from a high on postpartum
drugs. So my husband pressed his body against mine. And we waited. In
the dark, I counted ten rosary beads for ten toes. Because this is
how I count my way to God.</font></font></p>
