<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="margin-left: 32px; font-size: 12pt">	After
our mother’s suicide, my sister wrote a poem about the symbolic
nature of her death. She had a prescription pill addiction, and to
kill herself, she took one hundred and twelve pills. My sister’s
poem was something in the vein of “he who lives by the sword dies
by the sword,” et cetera, et cetera.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="margin-left: 32px; font-size: 12pt">	It’s
been a year since our mother’s death now, and I have finally
learned that there was not a single symbolic thing about it. I’m
not sure if my sister still thinks there was. But our mother killed
herself with those pills because they were there, where they always
were, on her bedside table. They were the simplest, most effective
method to get her where she wanted to be. There was no poetry in the
vomit we found her in. No symbolism in her cold blue skin. Her death,
if it was anything, was all realism, some of the finest ever
constructed.</font></font></div>
