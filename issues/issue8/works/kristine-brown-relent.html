<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
I was off, pedaling madly on a dusty dirt road, my disheveled
ponytail damp with sweat. Messy bun. Ball of keratin stress. I winced
in pain, my thumbs bleeding, brandishing shredded, gnawed-on
hangnails. Though usually self-conscious, wincing at the very thought
of hurting myself, I paid no heed to the perils ahead, already losing
balance after wheeling over littered soda cans sad in their disarray.
Worse so, I wasn’t wearing a helmet.&nbsp;<i>So much for being a
pragmatist.</i>&nbsp;I resolved to recapture composure in spite of
the aluminum obstruction. Or so I thought.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
found myself snorting and spitting, struggling to drain out the water
that rushed into my mouth and nasal tract. I could feel my head
throbbing, but I was too dazed to be sure. Listless, I closed my
tired eyes, the onset of crow’s feet accentuated as the murky
waters splashed against my neck. In Tom’s words, I was just “laying
there, completely knocked out, looking like…a sad death.”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
indeed, he found me, following the, well, sad death of his car
battery. Alone. By the roadside. Needing assistance. Feeling a
callused, clumsy hand touch my too-messy hair, I awoke to find myself
in a vortex of disorientation, ominous sounds and images compressing
my head. Gently, he propped me up, his hands ostensibly sanguine.
Moist.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
hit yourself pretty hard there,” he said. His eyebrows furrowed as
I rubbed the back of my head. “You okay?”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
suppose,” I muttered, discovering I had indeed fallen into the
river, scraping my scalp on a rock. Luckily, the pain wasn’t too
unbearable, though it still was unflattering to sit there, droopy,
dripping, and damaged in front of a total stranger. Physically.
Perhaps emotionally. My eyes widened in bewilderment as he ripped off
a square from his flannel shirt, not really seeming to care that it
was obviously ruined. Smoothly, tenderly. Yes, with great care, he
soaked up the blood that trickled down my neck. I almost backed away,
thinking he’d pull something dirty, but there was something about
him that compelled me to sit so still. Deep brown eyes, complexion
kissed with freckled grace. Even more enchanting—that chestnut
hair, the way it fell along the back of his neck. With a brotherly
gentleness, he cuffed my wrists, guiding me out of stagnant waters
while beaming a shy smile. Feeling shame that seemed out of place, I
turned away from his gaze. He noticed, and grinning so warmly, took
hold of my hand, urging me to let him walk me home.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
what about—” I began to ask, nodding towards the halted car. That
shabby, dinged Camry that no one really loved.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don’t
worry about it. It’s nothing, really.” He shook his head in
nonchalance, imploring me to follow him in the opposite direction. I
found this kind of annoying. But only for a moment. That accent. It
was not commonplace.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But,
your car—”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hey,
leave it alone, will you?” His voice grew cool, his irises subtly
dilating in slight provocation. I spoke no more, picking up pace and
trudging after him with my usual sense of caution. Did he know me, or
at least of me? If so, that was odd, considering that I’d never
seen him before in small suburbia. In my right mind I would’ve ran
in the opposite direction, but at the moment, I was too confused to
think of what I could be getting myself into. My mother always warned
me of the dangers of rape, regardless of my not knowing what that
really was, or what usually precedes it. But nonetheless, I walked on
until we reached my street.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
was an innocent joke, his cheap, frayed, bleached-gray jeans
contrasting heavily with the putter-green lawns that carpeted
Vermillion Drive. One sleeve intact, one sleeve severed. A scraggly
oddity, a living blemish among the neighborhood flock of pompous
Sperry’d boys. I had to smile, though I welded my face straight at
eye contact’s strike.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Nice
place you’ve got here,” he mumbled under his breath. Already, he
was scrutinizing my home, nodding thoughtfully at the scarlet
begonias draped over the creamy brick planters. He moved on to my
windows, appraising the lilac curtains hanging behind the glass. He
must not get out that often, I thought to myself, but I was too
overwhelmed by the day’s events to say anything.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hey,
you alright?” I jumped as he spoke. Deep, sincere. <i>When will you
leave?</i>, I asked in my mind, appreciative of his concern, yet
again, rather annoyed by the fact that he was hanging around for a
bit too long. More than anything, I wanted him to leave. He just
seemed so out of place. So plain, garish, approachable, scary.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
want me to leave, don’t you?”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
he had let it sink in.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yeah.
You’d rather me leave. You’re not even talking, so I think I’ll
go.”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Okay,
then. Go, I guess.</i>&nbsp;But for some reason, he would not budge.
Likewise, indifference paralyzed me. Stung my eyes, numbed my mind.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">So…
you’re just like the rest, huh?” He grew angry. Eyes narrow
ellipses. Icy and sickle-like. He sighed, and started walking in the
direction we just came from. The taut line my lips had been was now a
wide oval, uttering not a sound as he grew further away from where I
stood.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What’s
that supposed to mean?” I loudly retorted, offended at the
semantics behind this remark. “Hey, come back!”</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Why
do you care?” His voice was tense. Lethally, hurt. “You know, you
could have drowned to your death if I wasn’t there and found you.
Either that or you would’ve bled a helluva lot more.” Saying
nothing more, he disappeared in the evening dusk, the glare of the
streetlights pouring onto him like rain. But only when he went around
the corner. That gait was not commonplace.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Trembling,
and more perplexed than ever, I lumbered up my driveway, only to find
a wrinkled index card nestled in the grass. Scribbled on it, in faint
blue ink, was a note:</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>If
you ever need me, call me, at XXX-8521. Meet me at the end of Schley
Street if you ever need anyone to talk to. Yours, Tom.</i></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Still
uncomfortable after the recent encounter, I hurried inside,
cautiously locking the door behind me, afraid this “Tom” might
break in during the night. He didn’t seem to fit the stalker’s
prototype, but come to think of it, the note he left behind was,
well, creepy. I questioned myself as to when he could’ve written
it. Shaking off dizziness and grabbing at the back of my head to spot
any more broken skin, I dashed into the shower, just now realizing
that the piece of his shirt used to stop the bleeding was still
wrapped around my neck. I grimaced in disgust, but instead of tossing
the rag into the trash, I threw it in my laundry basket. Stranger
still, I didn’t even bother to take it out of the basket. <i>Ever
the bearer of commendable hygiene.</i></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Slipping
into a clean set of clothes, I crawled into bed, and though I didn’t
want to, I thought of him. The awkward savior. Tom. So that was his
name. He seemed so carefree, different from me in the sense that he
didn’t stress over much. I mean, what else propelled me to take
that violent ride down that vicious country road? I was pissed upon
finding out I’d earn a high “B” in advanced physics for the
present semester. It wasn’t a failing grade, but still, I felt
entitled to more. <i>Entitled.</i> Maybe I got what I wanted that
afternoon, getting attention from some boy that came out of nowhere.
Boys never found me pretty. And while wanting to get to know Tom, I
was still repulsed by him. Too different. Too…simplistic. But he
was lovely. Ashamed of myself, I shook my head, falling asleep in a
quiet room with a mind they all said to be unsound.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
next morning—a lazy Saturday—I awoke a little earlier than
expected. My parents were still not through with their travels and
wouldn’t be back in five days, so again I’d have the house all to
myself. Going out the front door to water the already-wilting
begonias, I stumbled upon a sight that left me dumbfounded. Lo and
behold, in the center of the driveway, was my bicycle. The one I rode
yesterday. How could I have forgotten my bicycle? I was too hurt too
care. Rubbing the back of my head once again (it was throbbing
something horrible), I marveled at its peculiar newness, the fact
that unlike yesterday, it stood tall, lustrous, and not so rickety as
before. I gaped, noticing it was coated with a brand new layer of
mahogany paint. Tom. It had to be Tom. But why? Why would he do
something so nice after basically telling me he never wanted to see
me again? Still ashamed, I shook my head and rolled my refurbished
bike into the garage. I ran up to my room, retrieved that modest
little index card, grabbed my phone, and did the unthinkable.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hello?
Tom? Hey, this is Collette, the girl you saved at the river
yesterday. Look, I just was feeling so out of it that I…I’m sorry
if I…hello?” Silence on the other end. Yet, I was soothed by his
gentle breathing.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.21in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
was there. Probably not as mad as yesterday, but still somewhat
bitter. I felt he wouldn’t hang up. And he didn’t. So I kept
talking, my verbal spillage losing its tremor as minutes tiptoed on.</font></font></p>
