were grazing in the meadow beside the highway. No surprise there.
Dorothy was sitting down. She thought it was going to rain. She
always thinks it is going to rain. Esther turned back to look at me
with her massive eyes. She seemed to want to say something but
continued her silent masticating. I had an itch on my flank but
didnâ€™t feel like going over to the fence to rub it. Esther lifted
her tail straight up into the air. She let out a lengthy, powerful
torrent of urine. There must be more to life than this.</font></font></div>
