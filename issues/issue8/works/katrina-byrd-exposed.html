<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Mary
Lyn can sit up there on the front pew dressed in all white looking
like one of God’s sweet angels all she wants. We all know that
she’s hell on wheels. She owns Big Mama’s, the only restaurant in
Hot Cakes, MS. My sister Lerleen works for her. Says she’s loud,
cusses like a sailor and she’s cheap. Won’t even pay minimum
wage. Lerleen says that Mary Lyn even dares to have a mister on the
side. That’s probably why she’s at church without her husband
this morning.  </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
light from the warm sun filtered through the stained glass windows
casting an array of colors over the small building and the
well-dressed “Christians” inside as Rev. Scucchi lifted his large
hands upward. Who ever heard of an Italian preacher in a Black,
Southern Baptist Church but there he was. Tall and handsome. Skin as
smooth and flawless as a fresh open jar of peanut butter. Eyes black
as coal and silky, dark, curly hair. When he spoke his mellow
baritone voice filled the room. Mary Lyn hung on his every word like
a tick on a dog’s back. She was shoutin’ and amenin’ all over
herself. </font></font>

<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">By
the time the choir broke into “Victory is Mine,” the entire
congregation was on their feet clappin’ and hollerin’. Sweat
pourin’ from brown faces. Feet thumping and bumping against the
wooden floor some on beat, some off.  Nobody ever would’ve guessed
that there are rhythmless Black folk but there are. One of them was
Mary Lyn. She was a movin’ and dancin’ to her own beat; her
backside bouncin’ like a rubber ball unknowingly revealing, what I
know in my heart, was only meant to be between her and her maker.  	</font></font></div>

a mercy,” I say under my breath as I watch in disbelief. That off
key singin’ gal they got leadin’ the choir hollered into the
mike. I couldn’t make out what she said but whatever it was it
prompted Mary Lyn to holler out and lift her hands. Mary Lyn’s long
black hair swayed back and forth as she stood there with her fat
hands lifted toward the sky like she trying to catch a bird. What
Mary Lyn didn’t know is that all her movin’ about caused her snug
white suit jacket to slide up revealing the back of her unzipped and
unbuttoned skirt. I shook my head and pulled out my sewing kit. I
walked as fast as I could toward Mary Lyn without breaking into a
run. The last thing I needed was to go to hell for laughin’ at a
cheap, rhythmless, hypocrite jumpin’ and hollerin’ on the front
pew while her shiny red drawers were a shinin’.    </font></font>
