in an empty square a pigeon pecks away against cement. Seagulls
safely tuck your memories in their wings. You name them accordingly,
praying some of them get lost. The river guides you, now that you are
free and without a past. One thing is certain: there will be a sea at
the end of this valley. Who or what will meet you there has never
haunted any of your dreams. You simply walk of course.”</i></font></font></font></font></div><br>

feet eventually grow weary and you stop every once in a while to
catch your breath. You start wishing for bravery or at least speed.
You start wishing for the ability to say exactly what you mean to

looked out the window. The crew had already finished with the
luggage. There was no one among them holding a poster with her name

better again. She read on…</font></font></font></font></div>

the air begins to change. It grows heavier with a salty touch. You

one is watching. There would always be time later to think about what
came next. She was still young, without children, and most social
obligations. She could enjoy this moment, alone, with an airplane
magazine in front of her.</font></font></font></font></div>
