summer Malibu eased into the Pacific, the hills caught fire and the
Santa Anaâ€™s made people behave in occult ways. Dads flushed living
goldfish down the toilet in orange Creamsicle swirls. Honest people
quit their jobs, quit kale. They acquired obsessions for Big Macs
with extra special sauce and had sex with strangers behind Thai
restaurants in the valley. Some drove on the freeways 30 mph faster
than the posted limit, chasing tangible things that were always
vaguely avoiding their reach. Others made Mexican Black Tar Heroin
their life and then blamed it on the proximity of the La Brea tar
pits, global warming, or the smog. Coyotes expanded their habitat to
Wilshire and Robertson. Venice and Overland. A man hung himself from
an overpass on a quiet stretch of the Glendale Freeway. The divorce
rate in LA county increased by 25 percent. People went missing on
purpose. Some just went missing. It was the summer I rode on Ferris
Wheels alone.</font></font></font></div>
