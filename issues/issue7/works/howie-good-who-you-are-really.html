the little blonde girl seated on the bus driver’s lap looks up at
you with a bitter expression. Posters lining the interior of the bus
advertise one or another of eight explosive facts about orgasms. If
you’re at all like me, you imagine a difficult future in which you
need help with when to use @ and when to use # on Twitter. You hop
off the bus before anyone in the crowd of passengers can ask who you
are, really. Shadows form an extensive part of the architecture of
the neighborhood where you live. A stranger in a belted leather coat
appears to be flexing his trigger finger just outside your door. It’s
someone’s responsibility to create this mood of anxiety, but until
now, you never suspected that it was yours.</font></font></font></div>
