Murnane had been lying in bed and staring at the ceiling of his
hospital room when a strange woman suddenly walked in. A mature,
nice-looking lady, she wasn't a doctor or nurse. She was dressed in
her Sunday best--a voluminous skirt, puffy white blouse he could
almost see through, and a pill box hat. He hadn't seen a pill box hat
on a woman since Jackie Kennedy was in the White House back when he
was a young man. This woman, however, was carrying a Bible, not an
elegant purse.</font></font></font></font></div>

Murnane, my name is Ophelia Barnes and I wonder if you might be
willing to give me a few minutes of your time. I understand you
recently had an operation.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

did indeed,&quot; said Tim. &quot;They took out my appendix and my
gallbladder, too, when they found it was bad. I'll be here awhile
longer while they run some other tests. At my age, things can go
wrong, you know, and they want to see if they can find anything
else.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

true, Mr. Murnane. Folks I know have been dying at a faster rate than
usual in recent years. It can be frightening, but it happens to all
of us. If you don't mind, Mr. Murnane, please tell me where you think
you would go if you died tonight.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

said Tim, beginning to get the direction of the conversation, &quot;I'd
probably go to Egan's Funeral Home up on 63rd Street. I went through
pre-arrangement counseling there and paid for everything--the box and
the plot. I took care of all that myself when I had to bury the wife
a few years back. Got nice discount. In fact, the plot's in St.
Adalbert's Cemetery, just up the road, not far from here.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">All
of that was true. Tim Murnane had made all the arrangements to be
&quot;salted away,&quot; as he had told his seven kids, who were now
all busy raising families of their own in different cities. But he
figured if he told this woman he was going to Eagan's and then to St.
Adalbert's, she'd know he was Catholic and perhaps not ripe for
harvesting for whatever well-meaning Christian church she
represented.</font></font></font></font></div>

Murnane, I meant if you died tonight, would you go to Heaven or
Hell.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">&quot;That's
an excellent question, Mrs. Barnes. If I had a chance to go to
confession before I died, I wouldn't go to Hell, God forbid, but
probably not right to Heaven either. I'd probably have to spend
several centuries in Purgatory, burning off the stains of a very
sinful life. And I have no objection to that. I will have earned my
entire stay. I don't drink and I don't smoke but over the years I've
always found women attractive, if you know what I mean.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

Barnes didn't really grasp that Old Tim, although a lapsed Catholic
for decades, was not about to switch denominations this close to the
finish line. He had been a White Sox fan his entire life and would
die cheering them as well, never the Cubs. So she was ready to press
on when Tim, warming to the challenge, asked a question.</font></font></font></font></div>

Murnane, If you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior right now, I
promise I will visit your grave. You could even be buried from our
church. It would be a beautiful ceremony. We'd love to have you, dead

Barnes, I do accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior. I always have, ever
since grammar school. I'd have never graduated if I hadn't learned
about Jesus dying for my sins from all those nuns, God bless 'em.
They taught me from first grade on that if I had been the only human
being on Earth, Jesus would have died for me alone. Of course, they
let me know too that I had to keep his commandments as well as
believe in him. There were only a couple of commandments I've had
trouble with. I mean, I never stole anything or killed anyone.&quot;</font></font></font></font></div>

that, Tim Murnane pushed the buzzer for the nurse. He wanted to see
if she would ask the next priest she saw making rounds to stop by his
room. A couple of priests had stopped in already but Tim hadn't been
ready for anything serious. Thanks to Mrs. Barnes, however, he knew
now that he'd like to give any priest a real earful. It had been 30
years since his last confession and he had plenty to talk about. At
74, he wanted to be ready before going to Eagan's.&nbsp;</font></font></font></font></div>
