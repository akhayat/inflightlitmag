woke without waking and without the memory of ever falling asleep. He
found himself in his bed, staring at the familiar spotty ceiling. The
lights were dimmed, and everything looked disturbingly crooked, as if
leaning over him. He was lying on his back with arms outstretched
along his body, chin tilted up; every part of him felt heavy as lead.

heart felt as if it were racing, and almost completely still. He was
suffocating, but wasn’t--</font><font color="#000000"><i>couldn’t</i></font><font color="#000000">
struggle to breathe. It was as though he forgot how to do it
properly; the air was still present around him, and nothing seemed to
be blocking his nose or throat. He opened his mouth, welcoming the
air with a slight gulp. </font></font></font>

was as confused as he’d ever been in his life, but instead of
inhaling he exhaled something that was more than air. He kept doing
that, transfixed. It wasn’t him working his lungs, pushing the air
out, but something else in control of his body--an invisible force
that drew the air from him. Stiff as a board and unable to breathe,
he was more scared than a child after a vicious nightmare--scared
like an adult who knows something is terribly wrong, and there’s no
way to rationalise and fix it. </font></font></font>

some point, he felt a strange pressure on his torso, like someone was
sitting on his chest. It startled him so much that his heart
fluttered warningly; the next sensation would have paralysed him with
a new wave of cold dread if he had not already been as still as a
statue. He felt a touch to the inside of his palm, skin-on-skin
contact, ice-cold fingers that he couldn’t warm up.</font></font></font></div>

was non-existent in this state, but he still felt himself getting
closer to the precipice of madness. Right when he was about to go
over the edge, he started to feel the weight lift off of him, pulled
from his very bones, escaping through his open mouth. The more it
continued, the lighter and calmer he was. He fell; his own bed
swallowed him up like a barrel full of tar. Wasting away felt awfully
like a relief.</font></font></font></div>

came to his senses. He remained on his back as he stared into the
waking sky which was grey and sombre with the remains of night. The
air was cool and moist, smelled rotten-sweet, and despite it being
thick with odours and slightly clogging his lungs, he was finally
breathing. It felt wonderful. In his periphery, he could see tall
grass and the outskirts of what appeared to be a forest. Once he
became aware of his surroundings, the sounds rushed in: crickets and
frogs and a weak splashing of water. He pushed himself up, leaned
back on his elbows unsteadily, and saw a vast lake. The water was
dark green and mostly still, impenetrable-looking. He couldn’t take
his eyes away from it. He was completely enraptured and terrified by
its mere presence.</font></font></font></div>

couldn’t possibly have missed something disturbing the
surface--something big and dark and scaly, that caught the weak
morning light with a gleam. It almost felt as if he were on his feet
even before the thing disappeared under the water again. His eyes
desperately scanned the lake, but it was tranquil again, keeping its
secrets.</font></font></font></div>

enough) the challenge in her eyes, that she will as long as he were
to stay with her.</font></font></font></div>

that, before this point of no return, he met up with his best friend
for the last time, just to say goodbye. He was being responsible.
Other people already set up his life for him, the marriage, the
moving, the job, a child. He felt so guilty, like such a failure. The
plan was impossible to refuse. He just wanted to see his friend again
so he could find the strength in her to keep his word. But now, after
years since the event, he knew he’d secretly wanted to find the
strength to stay with her. His friend was nineteen, taller and
sturdier than him. Her hair was a complete mess. She had wide
swimmer’s shoulders, angry eyes, freckles on her cheeks and the
bridge of her straight nose. For him, she was the best part of every
day. He never had the guts to kiss her.</font></font></font></div>

time he did, and she pushed him back, breaking his heart. But she
went along with him a horrible second later, immediately rearranging
the broken pieces by crowding him against a tree. Even with bark
scratching his skin through a thin t-shirt, he could only concentrate
on the touch of her hands on his forearms and the firm pressure of
her chapped lips. Her hands were warm, with just a touch of coldness
on the tips of her fingers, giving away that she too was nervous. The
goosebumps crawled all over his body and left him giddy, nearly
nauseous with excitement. The kiss was a bit overbearing--he couldn’t
keep up. It was kind of like she was sucking the air straight from
his lungs, killing him in the best way possible. He felt light-headed
with it, delirious, stupid. His eyes were half-closed. Sunlight and
undecipherable colours were streaming under his eyelids, overly
bright and cheerful. His heart was ready to burst from happiness. </font></font></font>

was a dream, but he could have had it, if only he were braver then.
In reality, he left her with an awkward one-armed embrace; her face
was schooled into a mask of indifference. But her eyes were still
stormy, like always. She was never calm and never uncaring, or maybe
she only was like that with him and he simply didn’t know any
different. He knew she was disappointed and hurting and possibly all
the things he felt in that moment too, but just like him she ended up
resigning. He wished she’d made the first move, crumbling his
resolve, choosing for him.</font></font></font></div>

found himself sitting a safe distance from the same lake. A fishing
rod was fixed on the ground near his hip, the buoy idly floated on
the surface of the water.. He felt tired and sleepy, as if he were
grudgingly waking from a ten minute sleep. His body was heavy and
aching. He must have been sitting in this position for a long time.
He didn’t know how he ended up fishing, but his sluggish mind began
to buzz just from the thought of what he intended to catch. </font></font></font>

him, the lake appeared as a deep abyss. It was everlasting and empty,
yet filled with dangers--a breathless and soundless place, as
frightening and as hypnotising as the night sky and open space it
leads to. The more he stared at it, the more it filled him with its
enigmatic voice. His skin crawled with indecipherable whispers, his
blood screamed relentlessly, as if the lake was speaking through him
while it remained deceptively quiet and aloof like a tomb.</font></font></font></div>
<div align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

<div align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000">His
thoughts were interrupted by a rupture in the water; the buoy bobbed
invitingly. And then, after a pause, it violently submerged. The
fishing line extended and disappeared, quickly swallowed by the
water. No longer controlled by his shocked paralysis, he snatched the
fishing rod, gripped the reel handle, and rolled what was left of the
line. The creature on the hook was strong and tenacious, but
seemingly playful and vivacious in a childish way. It released its
hold, let him roll the wheel for several seconds, and (with growing
confidence) lull him into a false sense of security. It started to
tug again, unexpectedly and strongly. With every pull it nearly
ripped the spinning rod from his hands. </font></font></font>

<div align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000">And
then it did, the handle snapped. The rod practically flew out,
spinning in the air. It tumbled into the water with a sharp splash.
And even before the meaning of it filled him with disappointment, the
water raptured again. The thing he was trying to catch showed itself,
and it wasn’t nearly as big as he expected. It was human-like,
small and underdeveloped--skeletal and malnourished. It was a child,
with grey slimy skin partially covered by flakes, some of which were
falling off as if the creature were sick and losing them. The child
from the lake barely had hair, but several dark rusty-red strings
among the scales on its head and face. Its big green orbs
aggressively glowed through the cracks.</font></font></font></div>

<div align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000">He
took a step towards the water, raised his arm, and reached for the
creature. It moved again, quickly and gracefully--like a sleek green
ribbon on the wind. It was surprisingly ferocious and powerful for
someone so fragile and sickly-looking. It flipped itself, showed a
fish tale, shabby but still glistening on the light like emeralds. It
went back underwater, something final about the loud splash and the
following silence. The child gripped his heart with a cold glove,
with the promise of no return.</font></font></font></div>

particular day was always on his mind, but until now he could never
imagine it as clear and real as it was then. Somehow, reliving it
felt like a gift instead of torture. He sat beside her hospital bed
and watched her, his eyes greedily tracing the features he started to
forget. </font></font></font>

slept, serene. Her shaggy ginger hair scattered on the pillow; her
freckles were stark on her sickly white skin--her body unexpectedly
fragile in a  baggy medical gown in this unresponsive state. Her
breathing was raspy and clattering, but faint. He placed his hand
inside her open palm, and promised that everything will be okay. He
thought she’d have been truly fine, if he had stayed with her that
day, years ago. They both would have had such different lives. It’s
a pointless regret, but he couldn’t help feeling it--the claws
scratched at his heart. Not hard enough to penetrate it, but just
enough to make it bleed. He followed his moral compass instead of his
gut instinct. He took responsibility. But sometimes, not running away
is running away. He should have stayed behind, where his heart was. </font></font></font>

lightly squeezed the hand he was holding, and she squeezed his back
upon waking. For several moments they just stared at each other, like
she was, too, relearning his face. His heart, the traitor, connected
all the wires between what she once was--how he stored her inside his
head when he walked away--and what she is now, in front of him. He
fell in love all over again, quickly and irresponsibly. She never
took any of his shit, and he was thankful for that. “People who
love you should accept you the way you are”--it sounds nice, but
certainly doesn’t work with assholes. She straightened him out,
made him less flawed. He smiled, while he remembered.</font></font></font></div>

wasn’t like that when it actually happened. He sat beside her bed,
she didn’t move; a white sheet was sprawled over her body. He
pulled it off and revealed her face. He needed to see another person
he failed. The vacant look in her cloudy eyes made him shiver. Her
head was mangled after the </font>car<font color="#00000a"> </font>accident<font color="#00000a">.

Love was a chronic illness that spoiled his life. It never went
away--always on his mind. I was part of everything he did. When he
touched her hand, it was neither entirely cold nor wooden yet, but it
was slack and cooling, lifeless. It did not allow him to pretend. He
gripped it nonetheless, lifted it slightly from the bed. <font color="#000000">It
was just a dead weight in his hold.</font></font></font></div>

fell on his knees on the balding edge of the shore. The grass was
scarcer and thinner there, the ground under it soft and squishy. It
immediately left wet patches on his thin pants and passed cold
through his bones. Heart in his throat, he lowered his shaking hands
in the dark water. They looked pearly-white and shapeless there,
unnaturally glowing. After witnessing something inhuman, monstrous
some would say, that was the first time he saw something truly evil.
Not just the light hiding underwater, but also the sight of his own
completely useless hands.</font></font></font></div>

he was in his bed again, and felt the air forced back inside of
him.He was reminded of the times when an open mouth in the wind
caught him off-guard, momentarily choked, bunched up in his lungs.
This time it was all wrong too, no resolution. It filled him like a
blow-up doll. He expanded with it but did not come to life. His lungs
were heavy and sagged, all clumped up, resting on the bottom of his
overflowing ribcage. He was dead.</font></font></font></div>

opened his eyes to his lips moving, forming words, addressing his
family. His daughter waved him off and laughed. “Stay close to the
shore,” he thought he said, because she was little and didn’t
know how to swim, because he’ll always be worried about her,
regardless of how old or strong and capable she got. He was always a
hard worker, but work consumed him as an adult, which led to him and
his family barely seeing each other. But in this memory, it was
almost startling to be so close to his daughter--to see her so
lively, having a good time, smiling openly and radiantly, as happy as
she could be in a household where the parents don’t love each
other. Her dark hair was wet and dripped from all the splashing.
There was an unfamiliar spark in her consistently sad eyes. </font></font></font>

always thought he turned away for just a minute, engaged in the
argument with his wife. The challenge in her resentful eyes, the only
times when she’s the centre of his undivided attention; but it was
a minute too long. When he looked back to the lake, his daughter was
nowhere to be seen. She was underwater, he realised with a shocked
delay, his heart stopping momentary. He froze and stumbled, like a
toddler making his first steps.</font></font></font></div>

breached the surface, dunked inside the waterbody, its guts dark and
obscure. It took him unforgivably long to find his drowning daughter.
She was unconscious, and when he wrapped his arms around her and
pulled her up, she was scarily heavy. When he resurfaced with her
still body in his arms, she almost slipped. His wife was screaming.
There was a &nbsp;ringing noise in his head.</font></font></font></div>

put his daughter’s small body on the ground and began performing
CPR, his hands and breathing shaking, desperate. He forced air in her
watery lungs while still struggling to properly breathe himself. He
pushed on her narrow brittle chest. It was covered in a sparkly green
one-piece swimsuit. In that moment, he wasn’t sure if he was doing
enough or too much. He was simultaneously scared of both his strength
and his carefulness. It wasn’t long till she flinched and started
violently coughing out the water, but to him it felt like it aged
him. He laughed himself stupid and listened to her life with
hysterical tears in his eyes.</font></font></font></div>

next time he came to himself, the water was up to his knee. The shock
of it was so unexpected and scary. it froze him in place. An
irrational childish part of him told him that he’ll be okay as long
as he didn’t move. The water was still enough around him, it
wouldn’t notice his presence. It still felt like a silent threat
around him, like he stood on a raising chest of a sleeping monster.</font></font></font></div>

he calmed himself enough, the first thing he noticed was the lonely
buoy in the middle of the lake. It jumped slightly, almost like it
shivered in fright, expecting him to pounce and catch it. He felt a
strange exciting surge of a gamble, a sick curiosity pushing his fear
down. He moved towards the buoy. Once he was close enough to touch
it, he noticed for the first time that there was no string extending
from it. Holding his breath, he reached and took the seemingly
harmless piece of plastic between two of his fingers. He tugged it up
and finally saw the string. To his surprise, it went down and didn’t
just float freely in the water. It strained. He pushed his head
underwater, but saw no bottom. There was only the bleak whiteness of
his constantly moving legs with all shades of green dying out in
heavy and clotting black molasses.</font></font></font></div>

resurfaced and tugged on the fishing line. He struggled with it and
cut his hands. Blood dropped in the water and disappeared instantly,
but the stinging pain only made him hold on harder and pull faster.
It felt a bit like what he imagined getting the moon would be like
after you lassoed it. The thoughts inside his head were an agitated
jumbled mess. He thought that maybe he’s about to be caught on a
metal hook and dragged underwater to be served on someone’s table
like a fish. Or maybe any second now he’d pull the plug out and the
entire world would be sucked into a pit at the bottom of the lake. He
laughed hysterically at that last thought, he couldn’t stop
himself. When the truth revealed itself, it was in some way even more
shell-shocking and strange. He fell completely silent, unsure.</font></font></font></div>

hands trembled on a newborn child he just pulled from the water. It
was drenched, naked, cool to the touch, and ghostly pale with spots
of grey hardened skin. The sight seized his heart in immediate grip
of instinctive bone-deep terror and grief he couldn’t possibly
explain. He was shaking all over now, bile in his throat, his heart
raced and occasionally skipped a beat, confused and uncertain and so
deeply, irreversibly hurt. </font></font></font>

was he supposed to do? It felt like nothing existed apart from this
cold lake. Time had stopped on this foggy morose morning and the sun
would never fully come up again. He had nowhere to go, no one to
share his pain with. An unnamed inescapable force urged him to put
the baby back in the water, like it belonged there. But he refused to
do it; he held it to his chest, breathed in the decaying smell of
lake water, savoured it. He could practically feel the last semblance
of strength leaving his body. It seeped out from him like a mixture
of blood and water.</font></font></font></div>

was almost ready to go down himself--to just fall back and let the
lake envelop them both. Anything to not leave this child alone, to
not be left alone himself. Just before he let himself go, he felt the
movement, a weak touch to his chest. He froze in bewilderment and
tentative hope. The baby unmistakably squirmed in his arms and tugged
at the collar of his wet shirt. He pulled it back from himself and
stared down at it, the child staring back, eyes big and blue and sad.
It was alive, she was alive, and his heart hurt even worse, his chest
so tight, he himself wanted it to burst open. He couldn’t help it;
he closed his eyes and sobbed, hard and unrelenting, like there was
nothing that could possibly console him, like he could never stop
now.</font></font></font></div>

this child was his daughter, he knew it, like he knew now that the
sickly looking scaly thing was his best friend. Remembering them,
people his heart ached for, ones he’d lost, almost felt like a
physical transformation. He finally became himself, filled to the
brim with losses. He hunched down from their added weight. He
couldn’t possibly be a man still capable of hope and levity, a man
that didn't miss his daughter every second of his life. He might as
well have drowned her with his inadequateness, his carelessness. He
dreamed of doing it, of putting her in water, almost every night
since he put her in the ground.</font></font></font></div>

became one with it.</font></font></font></div>

world went dull once, lost all intensity, and he drifted through the
motions; he lived every day clumsily without putting his heart in it,
and eventually he honestly wished life was a dream
world--inconsequential--a set of nameless rooms and places all
morphing into each other. Just like in a dream you, could leave them
anytime you wanted, and no one would notice. No one would stop or
call you back. Once you closed the door, what was left behind it
wouldn’t matter, wouldn’t even exist anymore. He wanted his life
to be like that, with a leeway, an easy way out--with the ability to
just wake when you’ve had too much. </font></font></font>

was weak-hearted or felt too strongly, either way he earned to be
untethered and independent from things he knew will break him--to be
like a ship in the open sea having nothing except shimmering water on
the horizon. He knew a life like that would have been lonely, but he
knew loneliness already, shades of it: the pressure, the miles of
going by himself before falling into step with someone else and still
having nothing to say. There was no getting used to it, but he knew
what to expect--something similarly empty, but more blank than
hollow--a solitude from beginning to the end. A one-man journey. He
learned the hard way that people you care about are not the ones who
sail with you but the riffs that sooner or later wreck your ship. </font></font></font>

being all alone where he was now, in his dark apartment full of
memories and things that don’t belong to him, knowing no one’s
footsteps will join him now, was worse than risking everything and
waiting for an impending wreckage. But it was selfish of him, to
choose the pain. While they were his losses, they were other
people's’ lives. His death would only help the world further forget
the ones who passed from it. </font></font></font>

resurfaced from the blackness, slowly and heavily, wrapped around the
large scaly thing from the lake. It was strangely warm, pulsing in
his arms, especially to his own cold and stiff body. The blackness
stopped moving and hardened, a bed inside a room, and he was
straddling the thing’s chest--stopping it from taking deep breaths.
His hands crawled to its neck of their own accord and gripped it. He
felt the fallen flakes stick to his palms and prick his skin. He
wrapped his fingers around the thing’s neck, and it opened its
mouth, there was just an endless tunnel of darkness inside. It was
the first time he could see its face clearly. It was hardly human
now, after the transformation, but still recognisable. His hold went
slack but he did not let go, startled by the revelation but not
discouraged.</font></font></font></div>

wasn’t it particularly cruel that the only thing from all the
things he was made to relive and could possibly change was his own
death? That was the only thing he was fine with. For a second his
fingers constricted, pressed even harder into the vulnerable flesh of
his own throat. More scales fell, the skin under them sleek and grey.
His own eyes, unexpectedly human on a disfigured, sharpened face,
stared back at him. They begged, starkly blue--the same shade as his
daughter’s--and he wanted to kill this pathetic worthless thing so
much; he was vibrating, salivating with it. </font></font></font>

stopped, disgusted with himself--with his weakness--not with his
ruthlessness. In no way was his holding back mercy. He used to always
choose the easiest way--way out, way in, roads already paved for him,
people ready to hold his hand through thunderstorms. He was reckless
by living carefully, not taking sharp risks, wallowing in his misery
to the point of always feeling numb and disconnected, He was so
deeply unhappy in his own skin an eventual tragedy felt almost
inevitable. Wrong choices lead to bad consequences, and like always
he was unable to deal with them. He didn’t deserve the oblivion of
death. He let himself go. His fingers slid over angry bruises, and
fell back on the bed. And as his dream self took his first deep but
shaky and wet breath, liquid cluttering inside his monstrous chest,
somewhere else he cracked his eyes open, letting sunlight and
indecipherable colours in.</font></font></font></div>

them. The charming voices you follow--all the love you’re capable
of--end up being your undoing, and just like that you’re a victim,
not an equal. But to them, to them you’re their siren.</font></font></font></div>

ground, the right side of his face in a puddle of something sticky
and wet and unpleasantly cold. The smell comes with a delay, but when
it does come, it practically devours his nostrils and fills his
throat with bile. He scrambles on his knees, hovers above the ground,
and leans on it with his hands. His open palms kiss the
spit-smothered pavement while he retches, chocking and trembling.
Even more blood, thick and dark, emerges from his mouth and burns his
swollen tongue, dry and heavy like a piece of cotton. </font></font></font>

feet of cold ground. He’d been heavily drinking till the sun came

wakes again, and it’s to his wife’s face, pale, her eyes

It only intensified his guilt, like even under cover of his plausible
deniability he still blames himself for them both. Last week she
packed a small suitcase and went to live with her parents. Said she
can’t physically stay in the house and sounded repelled with
herself. He let her go with no war in his heart, and that alone
finally cemented what he always knew--he hadn’t learned to love
her.</font></font></font></div>

now they’re on the floor of his--their--bedroom. She’s on her
knees and crouching, desperately searching his face. He’s lying in
the puddle of his own fresh vomit. He thinks she dragged him from the
bed, so encompassed by fear she wanted to get him to the bathroom
first. The faulty logic of doing that caught up with her and she just
stuck her fingers down his throat, making him puke out his poor
breakfast, stomach acid and all the pills he took. He lifts his head
slightly, looking at her, finally looking right at her face, and
there’s no disappointment and no judgement and no hate in her big
frightened eyes. He coughs, still unused to breathing, and she looks
at him all wrong, like she’s seeing a miracle. </font></font></font>
