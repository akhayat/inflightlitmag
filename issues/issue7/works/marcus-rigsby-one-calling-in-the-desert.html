<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What
compelled her to drop to her stomach and drink from a puddle in the
sand? They'd seen nearly every attraction the desert had to
offer—Rock climbing, swimming in the oasis, and hikes in the dunes
while the sun rose.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Perhaps
it was because drinking the water was the one thing you didn't dare
try when you went places. You walked around with plastic bottles
filled with designer water that everyone knows causes cancer (or
something), and you came home to your conveniences feeling like you
never got away from them.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Whatever
she hoped to gain, she must have found it, because as soon as that
icy muddy water splashed down her throat, she was ready to go home.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">2.15
a gallon for gas? Babe, get a picture of this. That's insane!” She
fumbled with her phone's camera function for a second before handing
it off to him to figure out. It wasn’t that she didn’t know how,
just that she suddenly found the touch phone and its trendy
interfaces tedious to look at, and she couldn’t summon the energy.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
snapped the photo while she watched without interest.</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
she thought back to their first night in the desert, in their
sleeping bags by the fire. At home, the night sky was dead and black,
but people still pretended to marvel at it. In the desert, the sky
was ablaze. Stars she’d thought were white burned orange or blue,
and instead of sitting stationary, they ran and danced circles around
one another. Beyond the campfire, the yipping of the coyotes turned
to filthy jokes, while the owls screeched reprimands.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
laughed at them, somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. Then she
noticed the stranger who had come to get warm by their fire. It sat
across from her, wrapped in a blanket and crowned with a broad cowboy
hat. She couldn’t see its face when it turned to look at her, but
its eyes shined black like a dog’s.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Come
out with us,” it said in a scratchy voice, neither man nor woman.
“Come have a drink.”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
it was too cold to leave the sleeping bag.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Tomorrow,”
she whispered, and she welled with excitement for the days ahead.</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
by morning the desert was lifeless, except for some dull-colored
brush and sunning lizards. They sought out the “climbing rocks”
their married friends had told them about. She snapped a photo of her
fiancé striking a virile pose at the top.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
lake was just where it was promised to be, and they both stripped
down to their bathing suits and jumped in. From the water she saw
what might have been a roadrunner. She was disappointed when a coyote
on rocket-powered roller skates didn’t smash into the cliff wall.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
they hiked back to camp, a hot wind started to blow her wet
shorts-leg up her thigh.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Selfie!”
her fiancé declared, and as soon as she saw what he was doing she
held up her hand to try to shield her face. He snapped the shot.
“This one’s going on Instagram,” he said.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
think it’s called an ‘usie’ if there’s two of us,” she
said, laughing so she wouldn’t sound annoyed. “Man. No one told
me the desert would be so hot,” she said, panting.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
should be okay,” he said. “As long as you keep hydrated.”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
the afternoon they checked into a motel in town. The room was a dump,
but it was air conditioned and within walking distance of Arnold’s
Museum of Body Horrors. There was a glass case of extracted tumors
the size of cantaloupes and one of mummified appendages. She took a
photo of a skull with a long pig snout. According to the information
card, the skull was human and once belonged to a man traveling under
the stage name, “The Bald Beast.” The woman felt guilty for
enjoying the exhibits so much.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We
should go back to the desert tonight,” she said.</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
it rained hard that night, so they went back to the motel instead,
soaking wet.</font></font></font></div>

that night there was a loud knock at the door. She looked.</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
darkened human frame stood in the threshold, only a little higher
than the doorknob.</font></font></font></div>

recognized the canine gleam in its eye.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What’s
your name, dog-eye?” She asked.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
figure stood there a long time but didn’t come inside.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">How
about that drink?” it said. “You promised.”</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It’s
a little late.”</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’m
a brewer,” it said. “The first. The one that calls the water from
underneath. It rises to the sand in pools, sweet with old clay.”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
woman felt a sudden dread about this other presence, but somehow she
knew she was safe from it inside the motel.</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
came to my desert to search for something. My drink will give you
power.”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
didn’t see what was so neat about it. Anyone could change the
numbers on a stupid sign. She glared at the tin slabs, bared her
teeth, and made them aware of what they were, silly markings
signifying the whims of men in suits</font></font></font><font color="#00000a"><font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">;</font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
men in suits who nobody liked because they were greedy and had
meetings with the government in windowless rooms and wore suits. The
five on the sign shrank from her and became a one. The two looked
down and realized it was a zero, that it always had been.</font></font></font></div>

had crossed into Nevada and were stretching their legs outside a

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Keep
your money, you cheapskate,” she said. “I saw something over
here.” Smelled it actually. Something in the great cement planters
that smelled like sweat and sex and cocaine.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Got
it!” And she snatched a five-dollar bill, rolled up and half buried
in the planter soil.</font></font></font></div>

miraculous sign. Right now.”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
ignored him and he snapped the shot as she climbed the steps to the

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hurry
up!” she said. He lost her in the crowd that met him at the door.
People were streaming to the roulette tables where someone was
screaming excitedly. “Four in a row! Four in a row! Sweet baby
Jesus, I love you!”</font></font></font></div>

“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">That’s
an omen,” he heard her say, but still couldn’t find her behind
the crowd.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Good
or bad?” he asked.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Good
for them, but that doesn’t leave a lot of luck in the room for us.
Let’s do something before they waste it.”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
saw her on the other side of the room, starting up the spiral
staircase to the hotel rooms. He ran after her, sliding his hand on
the shining banister.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
reached the top in time to catch her disappearing down another hall.
He jogged between numbered doors and forking corridors. Somewhere in
the maze of halls, animals were snarling, the way dogs do when they
mean to taste blood. He nearly jumped out of his skin when he
realized that one of the snarling things was his fiancé.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
found her glaring at one of the doors at the back of the hall. The
door fell open, as if faltering under her gaze. He looked into the
room that was obviously occupied, because the sheets were rumpled,
and a cowboy hat lay at the foot of the bed.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’m
going to steal that hat,” she said.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">No!”</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
went in. He squeezed his eyes shut. She was crazy. In a moment, a
seven-foot tall mustachioed man with steer horns on his belt buckle
was going to emerge from the bathroom and shoot them both.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
he looked inside the room, she was nowhere to be seen. He whispered
for her before looking over his shoulder and then creeping into the
room.</font></font></font></div>

<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
looked around, hissed her name, but she didn’t respond. The bed and
the occupant’s luggage obscured the back half of the room. She was
either behind the suitcases or hiding under the bed.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
climbed onto the bed. He leaned over the edge. Nothing. On the bright
side, the bathroom door was wide open and no one was in it. Whoever
was staying in this room obviously wasn’t around.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">he
thought, until a hand slid up his ankle and squeezed. Someone under
the bed hummed in delight.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don’t
kick,” said the soft, scratchy voice. “Don’t scream.” He
kicked. He screamed.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
thrashed his leg, but the grip on his ankle tightened until his foot
went numb. When he looked to the hallway for someone, anyone, his
fiancé was standing in the threshold with the cowboy hat planted on
her head.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Let
him have your pants,” she said. He ripped off his zipper and kicked
the pants free, then he and his fiancé tore down the hall.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Wearing
nothing under his pants had seemed like a good idea that morning.
Someone told him it was like making love to the desert wind when it
blew up your pant legs. But now he was on the stairs above a crowded
casino, and he doubted very much that he could make it to the door
with nothing hiding his genitals.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">That
was when he noticed his fiancé cradling an open suitcase in her
arms. It was stuffed with neat rows of dollar bills.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What
did you take! That freak’s gonna chase us to the gates of hell to
get that back!”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond,Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">No
he won’t,” she said. “It’s ours. As long as we don’t spend
it.” She unbound a bundle of cash and tossed the bills over the
banister. The gamblers watched the money float to the ground, but for
a while, no one made a move or a sound, not even the machines. They
