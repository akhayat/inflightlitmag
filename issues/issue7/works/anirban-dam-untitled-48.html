said, sheâ€™d breakdown and cry till her hands were steady enough to
hold my ashes and watch them drift away between her fingers till I
became a part of something larger than life; that way she would feel
my presence every time the waves kissed her feet. It was amazing how
simple her thoughts were until today when I realized the courage it
takes to keep a steady hand; knowing how the weight of twenty years
would scatter away the moment I split these fingers and I stood there
wondering how she said it all with a smile on her face.</font></font></font></div>
