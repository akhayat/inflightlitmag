born with Germanic roots (very different from Jamaican roots in the
fun stakes) her writing career peaked when she was a runner up in a
poopscoop slogan contest as a child. She has been writing crap ever
since. A liberal arts grad with a drummer boyfriend she has set
herself up for a long career in failing but is the punch line to many

her more successful boyfriend on their imaginary farm where she is
not writing 3 novels but enjoys procrastinating and collecting
imaginary eggs.</font></font></div>
