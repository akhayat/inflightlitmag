social justice and events, places and people she has known or
imagined. She is especially interested in exploring the boundaries of
dream, fantasy and reality. Her poem 'A Rose For Gaza' was

2014 and has since appeared in several journals and anthologies.
Poems have also recently been published in anthologies including -
Harbinger Asylum’s 'To Hold A Moment Still'; Stacey Savage’s ‘We
Are Poetry, an Anthology of Love poems’; Community Arts Ink’s
‘Reclaiming Our Voices’; Vagabond Press’, ‘The Border Crossed
Us’; ‘Civilised Beasts’ from Weasel Press; ‘Alice In
Wonderland’ by Silver Birch Press and a number of rather excellent&nbsp;
on line and print journals.</font></font></font></div>
