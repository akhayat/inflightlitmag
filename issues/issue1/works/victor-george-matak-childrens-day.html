The second test had been inconclusive </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> the pink line discolored. It did nothing in the way of exactness. It provided hope. And the hope was unreal. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">I sat, anxious, listening to </span><span class="T2">Bulletproof I Wish I Was</span><span class="T1"> by Radiohead and thought of computed ashes scattered unlike bones in a heap. How they would fade. They would soar toward connection. They would exist. Unlike the lull of an empty room. The room I sat in with my feet tangled between pillows and my head cold as the air conditioner shuffled and heaved the exigency of wind. It was turgid, the ceiling. And it was yellowed above my head. Made to be broken with working men. They would need to repair the mangled white stucco. It could not change, fixed and moveable. It circulated, decomposed and exalted. It was a ceiling made to be broken. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Immutable, disconsolate</span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1">words. They are on a poster of Brian Mulroney, my favorite looking politician one certain point. There is sticky tack behind the poster that has not crusted. But, this is none meaning. You hear the words and there is the other. What is more than words? What is immune? Nameless? Inescapable, it alters you and you are hit and broken and beauty is broken and all things are broken. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">There is a pause, it is near to love. It is all that you have wanted but it is not. It is honored inside of your memory. A head that is outside. You cannot change the past. There is regret, loss. Because it is gone and you are gone. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">It is the other life you have decided. It is the other life you cannot have. It is the other life that is the life you hope. It is gone as you are gone and it is broken as you are broken.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">My phone read: </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Go with your natural instinct. If you feel better, get a ring. One that you can find, remember it is temporary. Then it is a good sign, my father said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Linguine with clams, fresh garlic and beef tenderloin strips </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> rare </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> are ready for you and her. What ring size? Six? Kidding, my mother said. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Be strong. You've got me rattled with all this. Don't worry, my long best friend said, we're going to </span><span class="T1">get through this. Blood in. Blood out.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">My response was to say that I could no longer look at her. That it was the end. I told him that he scored high, that he was a true friend. That I prized him. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I'm hungry. I'll have to eat at some point. I'll eat now. Just text me when you want to meet," she said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I'll text," I said. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">I was wounded. My heart was driven and I was mad. Enveloped in the latter athletics of words, back and forth and back, to determine it was all and none. I could not refute and retract. I must expect to live and die and accept these things.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">When I had walked with her earlier that day, she talked of things unrelated. And laughed. Asking if those humans inside the music center could hear the cheers of the football crowd, the tremors of the stadium. And I was silent, hoping blameless. Luck and disorder, disorder and luck. Chaos. Misfortune. My head reeled with wordy concepts. Carving of selves, split. Fracture. Near and nearer. Hatched and rejoined, we would be sowed by the buttocks. A joke of ours. But, we dwindled. Our love dwindled. Our hope dimmed. Our lives bellowed. </span></p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">A heaving motion as the wind hurries and is rippled, smooth. High trimmed hedges and the red amber of banking monoliths that are the big city. The electric huff of a cigarette held in my hand. Wet is the ground. The atmosphere is lukewarm and muddled. A soft haze that is cool and sweet. A plashing of tree branches, whistling in dying blossom. Purple leaves that coat the ground, luminous. The crunch of steps, formidable and stolen. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What are you thinking about?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Nothing. How are you feeling?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Good."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"If there's something you need to say, then say it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I'm alright, thanks. Seriously."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What do you think?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"It's not for me to think."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"You have to tell me what this all means for you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I stand by you. I will be - when it is needed."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Thank you. You don't understand how much I appreciate it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">I had read the Hemmingway short story. I had submitted a piece like it to Harper Bazaar's Short Story Competition. I had written and written and it was all what I did not understand. It was engorged nothing. I did not know. But, then, there had been language. Transitional slides of faces, distant and immediate. The lost hearts of those we loved. Those that are gone, the lurid confluence of an assessed presence and what has come in-between. The way words shaped in her mouth. She preferred answers, the other's questions. This was her world, just and good. It brimmed with possibility but she came out beautiful and optimistic. She could give form to words. She could fling with a mouth </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> an energetic, thrusting motion. A magnetic frame and she made you sweet and masculine and violent. And you could touch it. But you must - only you do not want to. She was otherness. And she was difference. And all that I had wanted. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">A gravel road sloping downward. There is a single oak tree, hardened rigid bark between a narrow brick apartment building. Chatting and smoking, the gravel road leads toward the simple animation of an intersecting street. Blue cigarette smoke lips in the air and there a strong gray color that emanates from the brittle sky.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I've got to be somewhere. Just call </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> or?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"We'll see." </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What do you mean, we'll see?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I mean </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> I'll call."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I need to know how you feel."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I'll call, then. No need to worry."</span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">There were several of us in the Manulife Apartment. There was Valentine, and huffing </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> gaunt, enthusiastic and in a gray suit, cotton and kitschy fabric. Matt, his red velvet blazer and talk of the Fred Perry warehouses where you could buy extravagant suits for two hundred dollars. Paul, the musician, said there was division in Kingston </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> the homosexual community, submerged and voiceless. Samuel was a journalist though he had no tape recorder and looked grave, corduroy blazer, white pants. They were all null in their mannerisms, robotic. Necklines creased against fabric. Pants snug-fitted and smelling of iron. Shoes that clacked on the hardwood floor, oak and with cake and mango and wine stains. We were all eating healthy, though we did not know why.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"It's disappointing. I was raised there for the better part of twenty five years. Mike owns the Mansion. That's why it's an inclusive spot </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> he's like that, the kind of guy who doesn't get hung up on politics." </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"It's all circumstance and environment. They've been raised to hate these people. You can't blame them."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"They should know better."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"And how are they to do that."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Reading a newspaper."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">It couldn't be a Bohemian place. Orderly and precise, the dishes clean and stacked and the walls had no paintings </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> inhospitable, white. I couldn't afford the vintage posters in the Annex. I couldn't afford to manipulate the couches with exotic material. I didn't have time to cut out articles from National Geographic and join them to my walls. Samuel had, and kept these articles as items significant, attached. They were known secrets that bent the way he saw. An eye perception of diseased Ethiopians, bones </span><span class="T1">curved and limbs frayed. Buddhist monks soused in gasoline, ignited and anonymous. What happened after these photographs, then? Samuel knew, but the impression, caught and held - the established conviction of pain, photographed - overcame the people who would view them for the concise moment.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"It's the insurance which hassles you. It's ridiculous, paying two thousand dollars a year."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"No point, really."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"On the West Coast we have Air Care. Some stranger drives your car stationary, in one of those garages, and then tells you that you need to buy this or that. If you pay three grand then you're in the clear. All the eco taxes and what not."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"That's a scam."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"You see that it's Children's Day?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What a crock."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"No one gets the day off. It's pointless." </span></p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">"Why do you need the day off work? It's a nice concept."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"I don't have a family and I don't want one. Why should I have to celebrate?" </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"You don't."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Then why is it mandated."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"It isn't."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Sure it is. It's endorsed by the government." </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"No one said you had to participate."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"This is a bland topic."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Paul moved in front of the window. There was kind-heartedness in this flexing. He never debased those he spoke with, his head bald and glazed. The articles of movement, his face and smile that stretched into the room were condolences. He offered comfort and understood that words were useless. They were hollow frames of emotions. He lavished in the corrupted quiet and made others ease. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"You're the corner unit, right?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"That's right."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Lucky, man. My apartment is right in the center </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> you've been. I've had security there twice to complain about the smell of cigarettes. You likely don't get that, I wouldn't think."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Nope, the Chinese lady next door smokes black-market cigarettes. If anything, they'll take the old market lady first."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Matt patted my shoulder and laughed </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> the expansive, hearty laugh. He worked in film and I had done a feature with him the year before. But it had been months since we had reveled in the talking of woman and sex and love and money and security. He liked the amounts of things </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1"> to purchase, to return. The regimented fluidity of entering a place, foreign, and being articulate in what he came upon. It could be understood and controlled if you held principle. You could excite yourself with an item that was out of reach, out of touch. You are made helpless with what is inaccessible, a fault. But you can understand this excitement and this fault. You know it and you are safe.</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What's say you and me head down to Queen Street tonight?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What's happening over there?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Braden's got a private booth. The rich prick, how the hell does he afford it? The schemer."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Not sure."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Come on, when was the last time me and you had a night out, eh? We're likely to be dead tomorrow. This old body can hardly take the abuse anymore. It's unhealthy." </span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">The sundown enclosed park is empty. A concrete bench grates, rough against our buttocks. The under-apartments and upper-apartments are necked into complexes. A sculpture of a man on horse shouts and is trim and frosted black. It looms formed and is handsome, ample. There is contact from elastic cars that coast the traffic lanes like beached artificial metal. A hissing crackle from a bus, fractured into the bright pulsating mesh. A fierce-throatiness in loud metric connection. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"There's nothing left to say."</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Nothing, then?" </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">I want to make her surrender and I want to be brave, to allow for greater things than self. But, the words do not come. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Can you not say anything?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"There is nothing to </span><span class="T3">–</span><span class="T1">" </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"Say?" </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">We would and we would. We would not and we would not. </span></p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">"What else do you want me to say?"</span></p></body></html>
