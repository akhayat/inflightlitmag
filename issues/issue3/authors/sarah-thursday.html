Thursday calls Long Beach, California, her home, where she advocates
for local poets and poetry events in her spare time from her other
passion, teaching 4th and 5th graders. She runs a Long Beach-focused
poetry website called CadenceCollective.net, co-hosts a monthly
reading with one of her poetry heroes, G. Murray Thomas, and just
started Sadie Girl Press as a way to help publish local and emerging
poets. In addition, she co-founded Lucid Moose Lit, a small press
focused on social justice issues, with her poetry partner in crime,
Nancy Lyn√©e Woo. Her first full-length poetry collection, All the
Tiny Anchors, is available now. Find and follow her on
SarahThursday.com, Facebook, or Twitter.</font></font></div>
