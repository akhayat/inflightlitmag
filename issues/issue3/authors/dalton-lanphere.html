Lanphere is a sophomore English major at Daemen College with an
interest in Japanese literature, and aspirations of teaching English
in Japan. He has been creatively inclined from his youth through
visual arts such as painting and illustration (with one permanent
installation under his belt), music from a listenerâ€™s perspective
as well as that of the composer (A Certain Charm), and writing
(usually abstract poems and micro-fiction where flow and fluidity
reign supreme). Conceptually, he is influenced by impressionist and
post-expressionist painting, early 20th century literature, anime,
music, and a philosophy concerning sculpture similar to that of
Michelangelo. His writing often originates from the lyrical content
of his musical projects and places the focus primarily on the form
and structure and the relationship it has to other forms of art.
Dalton is 20 years old.</font></font></div>
