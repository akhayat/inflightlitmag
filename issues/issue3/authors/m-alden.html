Alden was almost named for the Brontë sisters, until her brother
enthused that her nickname would be Brontësaurus, at which point her
parents envisioned horrific scenes of playground torment. Instead
they named her Amanda and called her Michaela, and dared to wonder
why she was such a hellaciously disobedient child. Having given up
biting and spitting at people by age 5, M. has learned to tame her
feisty disposition with paper, a pen, and a nice glass of chocolate
milk. Currently she studies French and Global Studies in Austin,
Texas. Her career aspirations are as ambiguous as her nomenclature,
but she loves to love, and so far that is what’s mattered the most.</font></font></div>
