<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Born
in Springfield, Illinois, Charlene Carlberg, the younger of two
daughters from Reynold and Donna Carlberg-Eckstein. Her father was a
carpenter by trade and later ran a marina in Florida. Her mother was
a stay at home mom who was always by Charlene’s side. Full of life
as a young girl, Charlene embraced the power of the moment and always
searched for understanding of people and the world. Her career in
education for twenty-two years gave her the opportunity to share her
love of literature and writing to many students. As a mother of three
she continues to explore the world and serves as an example of
resilience and perseverance to her children. Charlene has utilized
past abuse as a tool to honor her blessings and embrace her role as a
source of optimism to everyone she encounters. Charlene’s poetry is
expressions from her heart as she learns and grows in all areas of
her life.</font></font></div>
