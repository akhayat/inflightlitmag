Walton is from Charlottesville, Virginia, and is currently a senior
in high school. She has absolutely no desire to go to UVA because the
campus is LITERALLY 20 minutes from her house. She didn’t always
like writing, and for the longest time she despised poetry. But, as
the years passed she realized that being creative was much more
enjoyable than staring at test tubes all day. </span></span></span></font></span></font></span></font>

from writing, Heather is a dancer, where she has studied RAD (Royal
Academy of Dance) and ABT (American Ballet Theater) styles of
classical ballet, character, and free movement. Her most recent show
was in February, where she performed a contemporary solo to “Here,
There and Everywhere” by The Beatles. Her favorite things to babble
about are the following: Sylvia Plath’s poetry, any novel ever,
ballets, ballet moves, pointe shoes, and her own writing. </span></span></span></font></span></font></span></font>

considers writing as a form of therapy, where she can vent to the
world, without anyone knowing what’s really bothering her. She
always strives to make her poetry vague, the more the interpretations
the better. She hopes to major in English in college, and go to write
a book series (the name she will not reveal at the moment for
reasons), and be as powerful a writer as Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath,
or Margaret Atwood.</span></span></span></font></span></font></span></font></div>
