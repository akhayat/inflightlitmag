Walton is from Charlottesville, Virginia, and is currently a senior
in high school. Apart from writing, Heather is a dancer, where she
has studied RAD (Royal Academy of Dance) and ABT (American Ballet
Theater) styles of classical ballet, character, and free movement.
She considers writing as a form of therapy, where she can vent to the
world, without anyone knowing whatâ€™s really bothering her. She
always strives to make her poetry vague, the more the interpretations
the better. She hopes to major in English in college, and go to write
a book series (the name she will not reveal at the moment for
reasons), and be as powerful a writer as Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath,
or Margaret Atwood.</font></font></div>
