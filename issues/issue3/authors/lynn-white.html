social justice and events, places and people she has known or
imagined. She is especially interested in exploring the boundaries of
dream, fantasy and reality. Her poem 'A Rose For Gaza' was

in October 2014 and has since been published in the ‘Poetry For
Change Anthology by Vending Machine Press. Poems have also recently
been included, or are forthcoming, in Harbinger Asylum's 'A Moment To
Live By' anthology, Stacey Savage's ‘We Are Poetry an Anthology of
Love poems’, In The World Of Womyn’s ‘She Did It Anyway’
