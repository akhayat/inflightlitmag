Miller was presumably born in Baltimore, MD sometime in the late
1980’s, but the only evidence that supports this is the author’s
word, and as we know, his word is rather… Dubious. While still a
child, he and his family relocated to some bumfuck, sqauresville type
of place in southern Pennsylvania where the townsfolk possessed zero
fashion sense and were made fat by a steady diet of Utz potato chips,
Snyder’s pretzels, and Big Macs from one of the hamlet’s three
McDonald’s. The author fell under a sleep spell sometime after
puberty, and when he finally awoke, he had found that he had
graduated high school and enrolled in college. After deciding that
playing in a rock ‘n’ roll band would be much more fun than
sitting in a lecture hall, the author abandoned his academic pursuits
and for the next several years, made records and toured a good
portion of the country in a rickety van with his two best friends. As
is too often the case, however, dreams die a horrible and undignified
death. The band broke up, and the author spent the next two and a
half years mired in a quarter life crisis, spending his days and
nights holed up in his bedroom surrounded by empty bottles of
Canadian whisky and every season of Dawson’s Creek on DVD.
Following a mystical LSD experience that led him to question the
foundation of language, the author decided to quit his bellyaching
and to start writing poetry and this, dear readers, brings us to the
present.</font></font></font></p>
