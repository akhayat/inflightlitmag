<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Stale
winds gushed through the trees, licking the frozen branches before
kissing the Hunter’s flesh. He stood poised with his bow ready
while the snow cloaked his menacing visage. Although his body was
still, his mind was hysteric, screaming with sorrow and rage bridled
in his chilled skull.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
had been exactly one month since his son stood beside him in the
woods learning to aim his small bow. He was not with the Hunter, not
looking at him in innocent admiration, nor would he ever be. The boy
was now buried under the snow and dirt, plucked by the judgeless
hands of Death. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Hunter lowered his bow to chip the frozen tear off his face. The cold
became him, numbing his body into a fearsome statue once more while
he waited for his prey. He would worry about his son standing in the
cold, but the boy stood adamant amidst the frozen woods. The boy
would hold his bow still for a long time before he shuddered as the
freezing breeze forced his breath out. That was always when the
Hunter knew to take him home before he caught a cold. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Food
was never as important than his son’s health.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
it was not the cold that caught him, it was cancer. His Father stood
by his bed, as motionless as he would while hunting, like a sentinel
over his son’s dying body. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
boy’s absence made the woods expand and the cold wind screamed
louder. The air gored his lungs as he inhaled and his eyes were
involuntary sealed by the falling snow and sudden lashes of frost.
Gently yet forcefully, he turned his head, looking for movement
beyond that of the cyclonic snow ensnaring him. Although the small
faun did not move, the Hunter saw him, brown and full of life amid
the dead, frozen expanse. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
faun was already staring at the Hunter, fearless; yet caution swam in
its warm eyes. The Hunter knew not to move, but would have to wait
until the faun was unaware, even for a moment. It was always more
painful for the both of them when the prey watches the Hunter take
it. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">His
son could never kill an animal, either he never wanted to or he
simply could not. There is a curious feeling that sinks in, knowing
you are taking life away. Even through countless hours or decades of
cautious creeping and silent watching while stalking the prey, death
only happens in an instant. Despite the long and quiet battle between
the Hunter and the game, everything happens once the last breath is
drawn. It is the moment that time itself vanishes from you that you
die. That is true death.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Hunter would never force His son to fire his bow, even if he had a
clear shot, He knew that firing the bow required true intent. He knew
the boy was scared of Death, which made watching him die an agonizing
battle in which he could do nothing. Looking at the monitor and the
dim green lights bounce up and down with an unyielding </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>beep</i></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.

</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">His
son’s eyes had been shut for days while he was on life support and
the cancer crept through him starting at his throat. The Hunter could
never forget His son’s brown eyes, they carried a longing to live
and experience life but also a tranquil glare that made him seem at
peace with Death.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sometimes
the boy would shudder in his bed as he did in the subzero woods. He
would often be the first to find the animal and tell his father where
it went, either to help his father or just to hasten the hunt, both
were achieved. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Even
now as the Hunter gazed at the Faun he could hear His son’s meek
voice whispering of how beautiful it is, but perhaps it was a rogue
draft playing a cruel trick. After steering away from the Hunter, the
faun fleetingly pranced through the trees. The Hunter crept behind in
the darkness of the trees, like a phantom hidden in the shadow of the
faun, clinging to it with every step in the storm. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
faun stopped and looked at the Hunter once again, and began eating
red berries off a bush, the only berry that seemed to survive winter,
and the only lively red that the snowy wasteland had seen… for a
moment at least. The Hunter often set a trap by those berries; they
had a distinct smell that always drew in the prey. It was an odd
scent for a human as it reeked of chemicals for miles, like the
peculiar scent of chlorine intertwined with sanitizing solution. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
the faun ate it watched the Hunter, seemingly less afraid of Him. The
smell of the berries ushered itself into the Hunter’s nose, making
Him remember the scent of the hospital, the new scent of His son. The
Hunter stood staring at His son while the doctor sanitized his hands
before adjusting the son’s feeding tube. The Father watched
expressionless as His son’s life faded by the second.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
doctor told the Father that feeding him would be futile, marking the
boy as dead. The boy’s body would no longer digest food, leaving
him to fade into the cold arms of Death.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hunting
was soothing for the Father, not sitting in the peaceful serenity of
the woods, no, but watching life disappear from his prey had the
ability to make Him forget His pain, and remember death is always the
denouement. Life is but a penultimate strand of pain, motley with
love until you are claimed by the hand of Death. That is all Death
requires. Man is born to die; he must hold his will to live every
day, making life seem an arduous task juxtaposed to death.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Hunter poised his bow, stringing a coal black arrow into its
position. The faun gazed at him and bowed its head for a moment
before raising it once more, its brown eyes rested on the Hunter.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Time
was still for a moment in their exchange. The faun watched the Hunter
while the arrow was let loose, soaring cruelly through the bitter
winds. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
continued to look at the Hunter’s empty eyes, two green orbs that
flickered between the flurries of falling snow. The arrow sent
vibrations through the fawn’s body as it entered diagonally through
its nose and out the back of its neck, locking its jaw shut but not
killing it.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Hunter let His bow down. His eyelids dropped and He felt weak as He
watched the faun jolt to life and leap away with the arrow lodged in
its head. The Hunter was angry that it was not a fatal shot, the
Faun’s suffering weighed on Him greatly.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">His
son would have been furious with Him for hurting the faun. His last
words to the Hunter were to only hunt when He needed food and never
to resolve His boredom through killing. The Hunter had to hunt today;
it was His effort to forget carrying his son’s coffin. For such a
light coffin, it was the heaviest thing the Hunter would ever carry.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
faun left tender footprints in the snow, scarcely breaking past the
first layer. The Hunter hounded the trail in hopes to end the faun’s
suffering as it was sure to die without being able to open its mouth
to eat. His body deadened while the wind marshaled the muffled cries
of the faun into His ears.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Not
very much farther the Hunter saw the faun sitting with its front legs
curled beneath him, sedentary and at peace it seemed. Its mouth
opened as far is it could, jittering the arrow and causing the faun
to close its eyes in pain, reopening them slowly to see the Hunter
before him.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Snow
circled around Him as he stood tall and dark. The dead trees behind
him did not creek and the wind silenced itself. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Faun bowed its head to the Hunter.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Hunter knelt down to the Faun.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
that moment, it was as if all the sorrow in the world was given a
voice. “I’m sorry,” the Hunter wept, his bony body shaking.
“I’m so sorry.”</font></font></font></div>
