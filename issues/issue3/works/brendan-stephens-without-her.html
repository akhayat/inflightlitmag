Roger turned the knob and a shiny foiled, off-brand condom was
dispensed, the restroom door opened and in walked some teenager in a
wife-beater with splotchy gray tattoos scattered over his arms.</font></font></font></font></div>

turned a light shade of pink.&nbsp;Some reason he felt like he had to
explain, so he said, “I’ve got a date.”</font></font></font></font></div>

lingered and washed his face.&nbsp;In the mirror, he scrutinized
every detail: a crooked nose twice broken, bushy eyebrows, the
beginnings of wrinkles springing up around his eyes, and the stubble
of a beard three days strong. He sighed. The least he could have done
was shave.&nbsp;The teen left without saying a word or washing his
hands.</font></font></font></font></div>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Roger
opened his wallet and saw a picture of Sheila, and he thought he
might throw up.&nbsp;For a moment, he fought the urge to drive home.
He’d done that twice before to Whitney, and she told him that no
matter how much she liked him, she’d not let him stand her up three
times.&nbsp;He took a breath, put the condom in his wallet, and
pulled out the picture.&nbsp;“Eight months and I still keep finding
your stuff, Sheila,” he said. He thought of her with her new
husband on their honeymoon right now.&nbsp;“I can’t do this
forever,” Roger said as he dropped the picture in the trash amongst
the paper towels and gum wrappers and chewing tobacco containers.</font></font></font></font></div>
