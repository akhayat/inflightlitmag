of you knew all along that I wasn't the brightest guy in the room.
Most times I never thought things through, which I suppose is for the
best because that at least left me open to the random stroke of good
luck, rather than the usual steady doom of bad decisions I'd often
make. I'm sure you can't forget the time I impulsively quit my job
just because I wanted the weekend off to go to Randy's birthday
party. That was a mess, wasn't it? Then I couldn't find a new job, my
old one wouldn't take me back, and so I had to move back in with my
parents. I took a lot of heat from you guys about that for a while,
but I guess we can all laugh about it now. Or one day you will. I
hope so, anyway. I realize my legacy will be one of stupidity and
it's too late to do anything about this now. It was my life and if I
knew any better, sure I would've done things differently, but I just
didn't know any better. I did what I could. </font></font></font>

know you're all wondering about last Thursday and why I did it. There
was no reason, really. Honest. I was just standing on the platform
and as the train rolled in, I thought to myself, I wonder what it
would be like if I were to jump. It's not like I had anywhere else to
be that night and besides, you hear about people surviving these
things all the time. Or at least I imagined so. And to be completely
truthful, I really didn't think I would do it. It was just as my feet
left the ground and as I felt myself propel forward, I remember
thinking, holy fuck I'm really doing this! I surprised myself. I
thought there would be a thrill, some sort of adrenaline rush, or
maybe time would freeze momentarily and my whole life would play
itself out again before my eyes, but no. It was just really fast,
hurt like a motherfucker, and then blackness. And you guys know the
rest. So please, there's no need for you to continue asking
questions. There's no need to search for some greater meaning in my
actions. I've never done anything meaningful before in my life, why
would I choose that moment to do anything different?</font></font></font></div>
