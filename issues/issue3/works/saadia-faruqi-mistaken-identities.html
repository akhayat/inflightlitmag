<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
were an odd couple who probably turned heads and raised eyebrows
everywhere they went. He was short, middle aged, spectacled and too
brown to be labeled Hispanic, with a full beard that screamed danger.
She was tall, willowy and younger than him by a full decade, dressed
in tight-fitting jeans and an open-necked collared shirt that looked
somehow offensive next to him. As if she was trying to annoy him,
although he didn’t look annoyed. Just silent. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
walked into the convenience store together, not asking the attendant
to fill the tank of their aging Volvo outside, just browsing the
shelves casually. They searched the neatly packed bags of Lays potato
chips and the packaged cheese snacks laid out like a regiment on its
way to battle. They looked over the cans of sodas and Gatorade
saluting an invisible general, but stayed away from the beer case. It
didn’t seem as if they wanted to buy anything, but the store
certainly wasn’t one that encouraged window-shopping. That’s when
the attendant got suspicious.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hey
you! Yeah I’m talking to you! Are you Moos-lim?” He was a spindly
young man, a boy almost, with buck teeth and a grating voice. He
pronounced his last word as if chewing tobacco and spitting it out,
barely able to hide his derision. Behind his beady eyes a gleam of
anticipation was apparent, heady at finally finding a target for his
boiling emotions. His mother’s escape to New York, his father’s
beatings, everything would be erased now that there was a real life
Moos-lim in front of him. They were a rare breed in this part of
Kansas, where even the blacks and Mexicans were frightened to stay
too long.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
bearded, spectacled man stared in the attendant’s direction for a
long minute. Thirty seconds turned into sixty. Buck Teeth grew
nervous. He coughed and shifted his vision to the woman, standing
with one hand on her hip near the paper goods aisle. “What’re you
doing with this guy, lady?” Spit flew out in tiny droplets and
rested on his lips, shimmering, waiting for something, anything. “You
don’t want to be mixed up with no Moos-lim, you know. They’re
terrorists and they beat up their wives.” </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
woman glared. “I </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>am</i></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
his wife, and he’s very good to me. So you keep your filthy mouth
shut, you hear?” Her voice was strong, loud, with a slight tremor
that belied her brave words. Who was she scared of, him or the silent
would-be terrorist?</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
bearded man took her elbow and pushed her forward gently, away from
Buck Teeth and his calculating gaze. They walked together towards the
restrooms silently, footsteps in perfect sync despite their height
difference. Buck Teeth left his cubicle and quickly followed them,
hanging on to his anger by a tiny thread. “Where’re you going?
You’ll need a key to the bathrooms and I ain’t giving no dirty
ragheads the keys. You’ll probably do some kind of devil worship
over there or something, or piss all over the floor like those Indian
people.”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
duo continued without turning around, although he imagined the woman
trembling at his temerity. They were pretty cool, Buck Teeth thought,
impressed despite himself. He’d have started a fist-fight at lesser
words. Perhaps they were used to this manner of speech, they who
stood out like sore thumbs in this two-bit white Kansas town. Or
perhaps they guessed that his jeering were just bravado fueled by a
lack of breeding and an abusive father. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Buck
Teeth stared after them, opening his mouth once more to heckle but
the front door opened again, distracting him quite effectively. A man
stood at the threshold, dressed in a lumpy blue sweatshirt with hands
in pockets in a classic stance that reminded him of countless small
budget movies he’d seen in the back room. No, not </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>those</i></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
movies, the other kind full of police chases in which gas stations
actually blow up. His neck hair raised, his bluster disappeared, he
froze where he stood, feeling an urgent need to pee like the boy he
was.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
intruder sauntered in as if he owned the place and everyone inside.
“What’s your name, kiddo?” he asked softly, like a teacher
speaking to his favorite student in the playground. Wise, polite,
nothing like a robber with a concealed gun. Buck Teeth swallowed
nervously, eyes bulging out of their sockets like a fish on its last
few breaths. “Sssam.”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Well,
Sssam, can you get the cash register open, please? That’s a good
boy.” He raised his voice only slightly, but it seemed to boom.
“And you two behind the shelves can come out now!” </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sam
turned around slightly, carefully, shaggy brows drawing together as
he struggled to put the pieces of a particularly vexing puzzle
together. The Moos-lim and his lady were part of the robbery? He
hadn’t seen that coming. Well, he had maybe pictured the man with a
gun at first, but his silence had unnerved him. He thought terrorists
were brash and rude, all ready to die for their sun-god Allah. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
couldn’t get his feet to move, worried that he may faint or worse,
pee his pants. That wouldn’t look good on the camera, and Lisa, the
girl at the laundromat next door certainly wouldn’t like to know he
was a scaredy cat. There were terrorists in his store, goddamit, and
he was going to defeat them. They may even call him on the evening
news and give him a medal. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
bearded man and his not-so-lovely companion came out from the
shadows, faces harsh and mouths open with indignation. The young
woman spoke quickly, in a low tone full of venom. “Larry, what do
you think you’re doing? We’re not going to rob this store, you
idiot, I just wanted to go to the bathroom!” </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Larry
smiled a ghost of a smile. “Oh I’m going to rob it alright, my
dear sister, you just wait and see.” There was a movement behind
them, and they all turned dramatically and bit unsteadily. Buck Teeth
Sam had decided to dash to his little cubicle in a valiant attempt to
– do what? He didn’t get farther than two feet; the gun inside
the blue sweatshirt was very real, and it went off with a sound that
made his bladder finally let loose.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sam
lay stunned in a sickly sweet pool of yellow liquid on the floor of
the convenience store, so badly shaken that he couldn’t really tell
if he was dead or alive. The lady in the tight jeans was screaming
her head off, which he found pretty funny in a stressed-out sort of
way. The bearded man was as silent as ever, eyes blinking slowly like
a lizard’s. He realized after a mental reconnaissance of his body
parts that he was physically okay. Either Larry was joking around or
he was a really bad shot, because the bullet had missed him, thank
Jesus, and lodged into the wall behind his head. He hoped somebody
outside had heard the commotion; he didn’t want to sit in his pee
for longer than necessary.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Larry
held a hand up to silence his sister. “Shut up, you bitch. I’m
not going to spare this idiot’s life twice.” Then to Sam, “You,
last chance, open the register and get me all the cash.”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sam
struggled up valiantly, but the woman pushed him down. “Keep
sitting boy. Don’t you dare get up from that floor!” She turned
to the would-be robber and wagged her finger at his face in a way
that thrilled Sam’s heart. Now this was a lady he could call his
own. “Don’t you see, Larry? People are going to look at Kamaal
and think the worst of him. Why would you put him in this situation?
Why would you do something that’s going to get his face in all the
newspapers and on television?”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Larry’s
smile was as cold as a shark’s. “Exactly.” Buck Teeth Sam
shivered, unsure whether it was from fear or pneumonia. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Kamaal
the silent bearded one leapt up in a sudden move that shocked Sam to
his core. He instinctively wrapped both arms around himself in the
universal symbol of protection, like a little armadillo protecting
itself against the big, bad world of maniac drivers. After a
millisecond he realized that the other man’s move wasn’t as fast
or as courageous as he had hoped. There was no dynamite, no assault
rifles. Kamaal was just leaning forward, nothing else. How odd. This
family drama was going to be the death of him. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Buck
Teeth Sam trembled slightly, lying back in the wetness that was
starting to stink, not wanting to set the terrorist off. He fixed his
eyes on Kamaal’s mouth, waiting to finally hear his voice. He was
suddenly yearning to know what Kamaal sounded like.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
the voice suddenly came, it was beautiful and mellifluous, even
though Sam couldn’t have identified that second word or its meaning
in all his lifetime. “Larry, please. I don’t wish for any
trouble. I don’t wish to be hauled off to jail because of my looks
or what the police assume.” The words were mild, the tone even
milder, the accent very New York. What the hell? Didn’t all bearded
eastern men come from Saudi? Sam released his breath with a whoosh,
realized that he’d been hoping for a hero. This guy wasn’t it,
thought. This guy had his own problems.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What’re
you going to do about it, you camel jockey?” </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
lady hissed, Kamaal held up his hand to stop her. “Darling, no.
It’s okay.”</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Darling?
What was this, the 1950’s? Buck Teeth Sam couldn’t take it
anymore. It’s not like anyone else was sitting in the stench of
their own urine. He looked around for a weapon, didn’t find any.
He’d have to do it the hard way then. This afternoon soap needed to
end before someone got killed. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
hauled himself up fluidly, noting his own ballerina-like grace with
astonishment and awe. He picked up a chair lying hidden behind a
shelf, not caring that Larry was aiming the gun right at him. He
swung the chair with full might, not hitting a damn thing, but
finally finding out what a bullet felt like. Burning, eating away at
heart muscle, oozing pain and surprise in equal measure. In his last
faltering breaths he felt disappointment, sad that Larry would get a
day’s worth of cash from the register, sad that the lovely lady
would see her fears realized, that Kamaal would be accused of murder.
Sad that he would never get to see Lisa naked. </font></font></font>
</div>

</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Then,
as his eyes glazed, he remembered the camera in the store’s
ceiling, bearing witness to the real criminal and the real hero.</font></font></font></div>
