isn't what you think <br>it's going to be. The sea, <br>muttering
some empty <br>promise to the beach, <br><br>is reaching for us.
<br>Speaking of which... <br>Isn't it time we unhitch <br>our flaws
from the whipping post <br><br>so they too can get <br>the most out
of life? <br>Or are we yet too selfish? <br>My dying wish has finally
<br><br>kicked it, sticking <br>to the side of my pocket <br>like
loose change, and now, <br>the careful arrangement <br><br>of my
pride is threatened. <br>You, my love, have been <br>to me a gracious
foil, <br>not because we're so <br><br>starkly different, but
<br>because we're exactly alike. <br>Don't argue with the facts.
<br>Lately, we're so at home <br><br>with what we lack <br>that our
first act <br>has lost its gravity. <br>It's habit we cultivate,
<br><br>based on an unstated <br>hatred of novel ideas. <br>Let's
admit this finally. <br>Let's admit ourselves finally <br><br>into
life's vast sanitarium, <br>don the white gowns <br>of mediocrity,
<br>and allow ourselves sleep.</font></font></p>
