sound of day cancelling itself - <br>it begins as a howl and
disperses <br>in a chorus of whispers. <br>In the forest of dreams,
<br>new ideas are taking root. <br>Life, for us, has been a sequence
<br>of moot points joined together <br>with the most tenuous thread,
<br>wed to a backdrop <br>blossoming constantly. <br>That startling
contrast <br>that counteracts the feeling <br>of boredom. So we went
reeling <br>along the shores blistered with shells, <br>discussing
the prospect of Hell, <br>and whether or not we fit <br>into its
schemes. <br>This we deemed unlikely, <br>something not worth
considering. <br>We wandered back <br>into the girth of the city,
<br>sharing cigarettes, <br>kisses, words of regret. <br>The streets
had bled out. <br>And that was okay - <br>in our own way, we were
listening.</font></font></p>
