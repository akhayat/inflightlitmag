if by magic, the puzzle <br>abandons its completed state, <br>dispersing
in a plague of locusts. <br>Just when I managed to focus <br><br>my
complaining into a soapbox. <br>I'd been straining too hard, sure,
<br>but straining is worthwhile <br>when you subtract the serpent
<br><br>from the beginning. <br>The festival collapses on the
revelers <br>in their devilish attire. Shots are fired, <br>sent to
the bread lines <br><br>to be wined and dined <br>by overzealous
bureaucrats <br>in Hallmark suits and this - <br>this is when the
looters arrive <br><br>armed to the teeth with their <br>peculiar
brand of solipsism. <br>I have to take a stand. Funny - <br>I tried
to take a sit, but I missed the chair, <br><br>so I didn't fare so
well <br>in this endeavor. I must now endeavor <br>more endeavors. In
hors d'oeuvres, <br>in orders and acupuncture, <br><br>in
dysfunctional dismantling. <br>I make a run for the Panhandle
<br>brandishing my starched collar <br>and colorful vocabulary, <br><br>a
daring do-gooder <br>with one foot in the grave, <br>and the other
unsure of where to go next. <br>Subtext of a sexual nature <br><br>is
stirring the pot. <br>I've got eight words left, <br>and no
arrangement in mind. <br>A thick mask of smoke and whatever's behind.</font></font></p>
