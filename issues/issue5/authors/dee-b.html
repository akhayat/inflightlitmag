B. was raised on a healthy diet of crippling food allergies, missing
pets, cabin trips, and punk ideologies. He received a B.A. in English
and a minor in philosophy at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and
still misses frequenting the town’s local video rental store. His
work has appeared in Black &amp; Grey magazine. Dee B. enjoys
spending most evenings archiving hilarious quotes he’s heard from
friends and strangers into his phone for bringing up in future
conversations.</font></font></div>
