she isn't being a pane in the glass, Fiona writes darkly humorous
fiction, almost always with a twist in the tail. Her work has been
published in anthologies and magazines (both print and electronic),
most recently with Riptide Publishing, Byker Books, Mslexia, and The
Pygmy Giant. Her second novel, 'Gleams of a Remoter World', a ghost
story set on the wild west coast of Ireland, was published by Riptide
Publishing in 2012.<br><br>Fiona lives in a slate cottage within
stone-throwing distance (never a good idea in Glass houses...) of
England's largest lake with her husband and a vast collection of
books. You can find out more at her website, www.fiona-glass.com.</font></font></div>
