are many different influences and styles inspiring Kyle's work.
Musing on the timbre and free-flow of jazz, to the crushing maelstrom
of lo-fi black metal, music of all genres continue to shape the
language of his poetry. Kyle infiltrated the Sacramento poetry scene

and the mysteries surrounding both. Themes within his work revolve

address familial relationships and conflict</font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></font></div>
