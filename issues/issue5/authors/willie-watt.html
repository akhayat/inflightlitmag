Watt is a poet and parkour enthusiast who enjoys musing on the
meaning of life until he descends into madness, at which point he
figures he should tell a few stories and get super existential about
things. He is supposedly a close descendant of the late, great Edgar
Allan Poe, but personally thinks horror is the lowest of literary
genres. He currently resides in Austin, Texas. Pretension is his
middle name and about 60% of his blood is whiskey. The other 40% is
self-deprecation.</font></font></div>
