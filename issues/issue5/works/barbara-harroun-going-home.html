<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
began with a gift for a one hour massage, a gilded paper certificate
given by Janey’s mother as a 40</font><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt">th</font></sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
birthday present. In the past, these certificates had found their way
to the junk drawer and moldered past their expiration date. But her
39</font><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt">th</font></sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
year had held a twenty-pound weight gain and the navigation of work
and life stress—like she was some battered canoe, unmanned on a
white rapid river—unlike anything she had ever imagined. Life was
unrelenting, and she knew it sounded like one of those terrible
motivational posters, but she couldn’t find the second part, always
delivered in elegant italics about how to get back up and persevere.
She just couldn’t. &nbsp;And she didn’t want to talk to anyone
about it. It was just such a fucking chore to live through it,
honestly. It took every single ounce of energy just to wake up and go
about the business of living a life that sucked in nearly every way.
She didn’t want to think about being broke at the end of the month
and still needing to pay for flute lessons for Josephine, or
registering her dog again at the court house and providing
verification the dog didn’t have rabies. She didn’t want to think
about enduring a work dinner with her husband present, and hearing
his canned laughter. He was more a roommate than a husband. Let’s
be honest. Let’s be really fucking honest. They were not the same
people who had married one another twenty-one years ago, and she was
done pretending that anything was going to change. So they went to
Luke’s baseball games, and Josie’s choir concerts, and sat down
to dinner and tried to throw themselves into work and parenting, and
they went to bed at different times to avoid each other, and Janey
almost hoped that he’d have an affair so she had a definitive, no
nonsense ending to it all.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Her
right hip was bothering her. It flared up. She worked at State Farm,
in a cubicle, and she sat all day. She’d given up running when her
knees and hips revolted, but now she walked, or really alternated
between walking and standing dumbly, lost in not thinking on the
Constitution Trail while super fit men and women biked and ran and
rollerbladed past her. She heard them coming up and zipping or
huffing past and she wondered about their lives and marriages, if
they sucked as bad as her own. But her hip, it ached, how it ached,
like a bad tooth needing a root canal, and stretching just helped
briefly and she was taking more Tylenol than she should, and it
wasn’t really helping. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
Thursday morning, she woke, and she made coffee and made lunches, and
she didn’t kiss her husband good-bye and he didn’t notice, and
once the bus came and the house was empty of her children, she sat
down and had a beer and cold, left over burrito for breakfast because
it was what she wanted, oddly, and then she uncapped another beer and
called in sick for work. It had been three years since she called in
sick. She nursed her beer, peeled the label off slowly and with great
precision, imagining some professional restorer trying to get a
priceless stamp off of an envelope of no consequence. She waited
until 9:00, when the spa was open, and she called to make an
appointment.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">For
today, she told the receptionist. As soon as possible. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Preference
for the Massage Therapist?” was the perky reply.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’m
not sure what you mean,” Janey said.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Male
or female therapist?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Janey
paused. Considered. It would be weird to be massaged by a man. Just
weird.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Female.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We
can do tomorrow or Monday, but not today. Only Tanner is available
today for deep tissue massage. Tanner is male.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Then
set me up with Tanner.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Can
you be here at 9:45 for paperwork with a 10:00 massage appointment?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yes.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yay!”
The receptionist was too happy for Janey. It made her uncomfortable.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yay.”
And with that, Janey hung up and went to shower.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
shaved carefully, and washed her feet, thinking they may get touched.
It had been a decade since her last massage, after Luke was born, and
the therapist had talked about </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Star
Wars</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the whole
time. She did not try to imagine Tanner or anticipate how the massage
would proceed.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
wasn’t attractive, not in a hot and muscly way, but he had a
wide-open face and he smiled shyly. His eyes were brown and warm, and
he asked if she was ready. He was barefooted, and wearing khaki
shorts and a t-shirt with the spa logo emblazoned on it. He was
young, maybe twenty-five, and his hair was long, clean, and brushed
away from his face. He pointed out the clothes hook and told her to
slide under the comforter and sheet, face down, in the pillow, and
then he left with her clipboarded paperwork. She took off everything
but her underwear. A moment later, he knocked gently.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Come
in,” Janey called.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Are
you comfortable?” He asked.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
nodded, face hidden. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Is
the table warm enough?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fine.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Music
too loud or okay?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Okay.”
</font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We’ll
start with your back. Let me know at any point if you are
uncomfortable or I’m going too deep.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
nodded again.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Five
minutes in, she was crying. Tears sliding down through the donut hole
of the weird face pillow and plopping on the tile floor. It was
because she had to feel her body, how hungry it was. How lonely. How
deserted.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Okay?”
Tanner asked. His voice was concerned, and she wondered how long it
had been since she had been asked with such curiosity. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fine.
Sorry.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Totally
normal. Totally okay. Honestly.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
the thirty-minute mark he said quietly, “I’m going to move to the
hips and buttocks. I spent more time than I usually do on your back.
I thought I should. There’s a lot going on there. It’s amazing
what the body will get used to. I don’t want to lecture, but you’re
asking a lot of your back. Be kind to it. Be kind to yourself.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
it was true. She treated her body like it was a stranger’s, just
something she dressed and did it’s hair and makeup, like some crazy
doll she hated and it creeped her out thinking of her own body in
such a way, but it was true, but then he did this thing, this pulling
back of the right hip while placing a steady hand on the small of her
back and a sound escaped her; half-sigh, half-groan. He took away
that aching pain. Released it. She imagined a cloud of starlings
alighting—all that hurt in flight.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Is
it uncomfortable?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Nonononono.No.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
worked on her legs, then her feet, and she felt no
self-consciousness. None. It was like he was reading her body,
something she couldn’t do herself. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Neck
last,” he said, “and then I’ll leave you alone. Take your time.
It was nice meeting you.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Thank
you,” she said, “Thank you so much. Thank you.” Her voice
seemed not her own. And it pained her to hear her gratitude like a
plea. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
he was gone, she dressed hurriedly. She wanted out. The lobby was too
bright, too clean. The receptionist was too young, too enthusiastic,
too blonde and bright and manicured. She tipped extravagantly, and
could read the face of the receptionist—surprised she didn’t want
change for a $20 on a $60 massage. But Janey didn’t care, in fact
she wanted to make another appointment for next week, with Tanner,
and every week thereafter, but then she thought about how it would
look. Pathetic and perverted. A middle-aged woman in such desperate
need it verged on prostitution.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
the parking lot she cried. The spa was in a sad strip mall, and an
obese woman in shorts, a white tank top, and flip flops, waiting by a
bus stop sign watched her calmly, head on, until Janey put her head
on the steering wheel to hide her face. Tanner had revealed her body
to her, and it was a marvelous, mysterious gift. But it was
terrifying too. Because where could she go after being read in such a
way? Touched in such a way? She white knuckled the steering wheel,
her keys still buried at the bottom of her purse. She caught her own
eye in the rearview mirror. Yesterday’s mascara seemed a smudged
message. Surely not home, where no kindness awaited her, not even
from her own damn self.</font></font></div>
