to my whisper: if I should ever make a 1970’s face while we make
love, while we are making current-day love, while we are making
contemporary love, I will completely understand if you immediately
decide to end things between us, even if means that you decide to end
things right there in mid-midnight coitus, on our ruby-red silken
sweat-bed, on our body-fluid waterbed, on our black jiggly raft,
afloat on the splorchy, wet dreams of our loinhawks. Even it means
that you end </font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>me</i></font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
If I should ever grit my throat or groan my teeth or grimace in the
way that the despicable, turquoise and greasy people of the 1970’s
did, you will have the natural right to kill me until I die to death
in our marriage room. We both have studied history and we have
learned from it; we know that all of the people of the 1970’s,
without exception, were pornographic people. And that they were
greasy also. So greasy, the word should be spelled with two e’s, a
z and a y: </font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>greezy</i></font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
We both know that the shiny, polyester people of the 1970’s made
porn pancakes when they made pancakes, and that they made porn
castles when they made sand castles and that they made porn love when
they made love, that they exchanged their body greases freely, and
that sequins popped off of them when they reproduced and made babies
that reeked of Coppertone and mustache wax, and there is no way to go
back in time to stop them; there is no way to go back in hope to stop
them; there is no way to go back in love to stop them. In all of my
purple life, I have tried, and succeeded, in my own small and
God-blessed way, to prevent my hair from ever looking 1970’s.
Dreams are made from the woody, brown-stained hope chest in the
chest, from inside of us. Dreams don’t come from the 1970’s,
those aquamarine and gaudy years. Nightmares come from there, and we
won’t lovemake in the mean, uncouth dark of such a Jordache place.
