<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Eric's
nipple fell off today. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
sure rattled the locker room three weeks ago. What a gesture for a
seventeen-year old backstroker whose father won't even let him drive.
Pierces his nipple with a safety pin on a Tuesday afternoon before
swim practice, the February cold and pool chemicals cauterizing and
cleansing the wound so his mother can't find out and rein in her
precious small town punk, so sexy to my invisible freshman eyes. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
watched him from the far corner, flicking that antiseptic Zippo and
floating the unsafe portion of the safety pin through the campfire
warmth of the flame back and forth, each pass increasing excitement
among the swimmers while secretly purchasing courage. Showmanship.
The bearded majority team captain finally called his bluff so we
looked away and then heard a pop and a choir of gasps. He did it. A
one-inch safety pin through the smooth pink punctuation of his bronze
left pectoral, ringed with the coarse black hair of burgeoning
manhood. I wanted to kiss it and make sure he was okay but I just
stared into the rusting orange locker of my rookie season and caught
my breath and pretended I wasn't impressed with shaggy-haired sham
rebels. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Swim
practices began to roll into one another through winter darkness, me
pretending not to steal glances at that righteous pin tunneling
through Mt. Olympus, each day reinforcing how much of a coward I am.
Then today the mercury rises and a rare strawberry spring allows us
out on the quad for an impromptu early March lunch recess. Cooped up
boys become mountain rams, wrestling for a spot on the picnic tables
spelling out the initials of the school. Look, I hate sports. I hate
the patriarchal&nbsp;pyramid&nbsp;of sports. My high
school&nbsp;querencia&nbsp;is the art room and swimming is just a
solitary way to appease the jocks in my life. I never fight. I always
fly. But seeing proud Eric as reigning king of picnic table mountain
made me want IN. I tossed my sketchbook therapist to the ground and
charged, over a fat kid welder from shop class and atop the shoulders
of the dry docked JV quarterback. I grabbed that safety pin through
his white tee and pulled with a sharp twist widdershins.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He'll
never forget me now. I have his nipple. Woke up with it on the sodden
grass of the fast-thawed quad, still pierced by the pin, framed by a
blood-stained scrap of Marlon Brando t-shirt. I was never one for
trophies before today.</font></font></div>
