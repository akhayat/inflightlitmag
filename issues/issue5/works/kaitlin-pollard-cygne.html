<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr">
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
stands in front of a mirror. He’s wearing a simple slip of a white
dress. The thin fabric hugs the curves of his hips and dips low at
the collar to display a shadow of cleavage; the hem flirts with the
very tops of his thighs, leaving little to the imagination. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
hates the dress. The fluid material settles so close to his body and
displays the sheen of his metal limbs for all to see. The way people,
mostly men, respond to the dress sickens him. Voracious stares
assessing just how much of his body is metal and how much is still
warm, pliable skin. He makes a point to flutter just out of reach of
the men who appraise him with such calculating expressions. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Still,
the men with the shameless stares do not compare to Chirurgien, who
forces Cy to wear the white dress for her special dinners. On the
nights Chir expects him to model his metal limbs, she enters his room
with the dress in hand. She sits at the foot of his bed, lays the
dress out with care, and asks Cy to sit with his back facing her. She
picks up a fine-bristled brush from his vanity, and sweeps it through
his long ash-blond hair. She speaks to him in a soothing murmur as
she works.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Such
beautiful hair,” she compliments him. “You have become such a
striking young lady. An enchanting sylph, flittering among men.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chir’s
admiration makes Cy cringe.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
need you to join me tonight. I have guests who would like to meet
you. My praise has made them curious. They want to see you. They want
to admire you. Will you come down to dinner for my guests? I brought
your favorite dress to wear.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
cannot stop himself from shuddering when her hand brushes the skin of
his shoulder, a touch meant to be motherly and comforting.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Are
you cold, little swan?” Chir asks with concern.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
shakes his head but remains still on the bed. Chir sighs and her
touch withdraws. Cy waits to feel her weight lift from the bed before
he shifts away.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’ll
leave you to dress for dinner.” Chir stands and regards Cy with an
affectionate look. “Pin your hair up tonight. My guests would like
to see all of your enhancements. You look beautiful, as always
Cygne.” </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
white dress remains, neatly laid out across the bed, waiting. Cy
paces in his room until the time arrives to slip into the dress and
present himself to Chir’s guests downstairs. He can taste bile
rising at the back of his throat. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
clients who admire Cy’s high-class prosthetics do not know the pain
he feels at his seams. His legs swell if he stands too long on his
elegantly designed aluminum legs. His skin chafes against the metal.
When he retires to his bedroom, he unlatches the prosthetics to find
new sores opening on the scars of the old. One night among clients
downstairs means at least three days and nights of bed-ridden pain
upstairs. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Even
so, Cy does as Chir asks of him. He never forgets how much he depends
on her. She never allows him to.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
occasion, Chir asks Cy to pay careful attention to special guests at
her dinners. Generally, this entails allowing the potential buyers to
inspect his hardware and answer questions. They ask how the
prosthetics feel. He lies and tells them he feels nothing. They ask
how difficult maintenance is. He lies and tells them it is
effortless. They ask if he would recommend others voluntarily opt for
the prosthetics surgery. He lies and tells them he thinks everyone
should replace their legs and arms with metal parts. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There
is one night when an older man does not stop at Cy’s prosthetics.
He slides his hand over the seam of his aluminum arm, and at first Cy
thinks he’s admiring how smooth the transition is between metal and
flesh. But then his fingertips continue, until they disappear into
the fabric of Cy’s dress. He handles Cy’s breast and squeezes it
appraisingly.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Are
these real?” he asks.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">No,”
Cy responds in a strained and mechanical voice. The familiar feel of
bile rising in the back of his throat is expanding. He can feel his
stomach clench. He’s about to throw up on the man if he does not
remove his hand.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Richard,”
Chir sweeps in with a light, melodic laugh. “Please, not all of my
little swan is meant for inspection by hand. After all, she is still
a respectable, young lady.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
man, Richard, looks confused. Cy is glad to see Chir pull the man
away for a drink at the bar, before he retires to his bedroom early.
That night, when he sleeps, he dreams of detaching his breasts along
with his aluminum prosthetics, setting them down on the nightstand
alongside his other stand-in body parts. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
by now, Cy knows well the pain associated with absence and the pain
associated with replacement. He knows there will always be something
missing, something not necessarily irreplaceable, but missing all the
same. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fleur
is the first person Cy thinks of in a sexual way. At first, he finds
it odd. What is disorienting and conflicting about his own naked
reflection is attractive and beautiful on Fleur. He admires the
curves of her body in the colorful cocktail dresses she often wears
to dinner with Chir. She is an athletic woman, and he finds himself
attracted to the juxtaposition of her muscular calves and strong back
with her small breasts and rounded hips. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fleur
is a frequent guest at Chirurgien’s dinners. She differs from the
usual attendees in that she comes to the dinners with a genuine
scientific interest in Chir’s prosthetics, rather than their
aesthetic applications. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
Fleur speaks to Cy, she talks mostly about the work she does for her
patients. She discusses advancements in prosthetic technology with
Cy, and marvels at the positive impact those advancements will have.
She tells gruesome stories about how some of her patients lost their
limbs, and other odd, funny stories about how prosthetics can be
damaged in the oddest ways. Cy enjoys listening to her stories the
most because he doesn’t have many of his own to share. Cy finds it
doesn’t matter much—Fleur talks enough for the two of them
anyhow.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fleur
sometimes discusses the limitations of prosthetics with Cy. More than
anything, she is frustrated with the slow advances in neural science
that would allow patients with prosthetics limbs to recover something
like sensation in their limbs. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
there comes a night when Fleur has good news to share. She smiles as
she tells him about a recent neural study that identified new
surgical methods to implant stem cells and encourage regrowth of
healthy nerve cells. Cy can’t understand all of the details. Fleur
uses a lot of medical jargon to describe what the doctors did to the
mice. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What
are you so excited about though? A study on mice seems like a far cry
from helping any of your patients,” Cy asks.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Maybe
not today or tomorrow, but this is a major breakthrough in neural
science that will change the path of medicine. It could be the bridge
for prosthetic sensation. It could be the science that helps reverse
paralysis. It could improve the outcome of gender reassignment
surgeries. There are a million different ways this study could impact
the future. It could help so many people improve their lives.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
way you describe it, it sounds amazing, like it could save the
world.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
should be excited too, you know. Your mother will find a way to
harness that technology one day, and then you’ll be able to tell me
how it feels.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
smiles and nods politely. Fleur doesn’t notice when he changes the
subject, prodding her to talk about a new patient. He doesn’t like
to talk about Chir’s support of cutting-edge medicine. He doesn’t
like to think about what she’ll chip away next. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Discreet
wires connect Cy’s prosthetics to the central line of communication
with his brain. The prosthetics control implants in his brain, which
sense thought impulses and trigger movement in his prosthetics. It is
the technology that made Chir wealthy and famous for her prosthetic
designs. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Using
the technology is not as easy as simply thinking a movement however.
Users need to train their mind to activate the prosthetic technology.
For a single prosthetic limb, training and therapy takes over a year.
For Cy, mastering his four limbs fully took over three and a half
years. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">During
his recovery, Chir was patient. She encouraged Cy through his
struggles, and celebrated even his most minute accomplishments. After
years of relearning how to grasp objects, of struggling to balance
and take steps forward, the final test for Cy’s progress was
learning how to dance. The day Cy could perform a full waltz with
smooth, practiced precision was the day Chir deemed him ready for
public display. Her investment in him would finally reap her rewards.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After
several glasses of champagne, and a playful bow for Fleur’s hand,
Cy convinces Fleur to dance with him.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
don’t know what I’m doing,” Fleur protests. “I’m a
scientist, remember?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don’t
worry, I’ll lead you. I’m a trained professional,” Cy promises
with a wink. Other party guests are already dancing, while others
look on with amusement at Fleur and Cy.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">How
much have you had to drink?” Fleur asks Cy.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Enough,”
he responds. “What about you?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One,
but I think I’ll need a few more after I’m done embarrassing
myself,” Fleur responds wryly. Cy laughs and readjusts Fleur’s
hand on his shoulder. He enjoys the feeling of holding Fleur close
while they whirl about the dance floor.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Just
follow my lead. I will take you where you need to go. And mind your
feet. I may not be able to feel my toes but you can still damage my
prosthetics.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fleur
shakes her head, laughing. “You’re drunk and you still dance
better than I do.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yes,
well, maybe you would have danced better if you drank some more,”
Cy suggests.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fleur
grins at Cy mischievously. “Next time then.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
companionable silence falls between the two as the music times their
steps. Fleur’s hand gradually grows slack on Cy’s shoulder,
prompting him to correct her once more.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
laughs. “Thank you. You really do know what you’re doing, don’t
you?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
nods. “Chir hired an instructor for me to learn when I was younger.
It was the last test she had for me before she deemed me ready to
stand on my own two feet.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Ah,
I see. Well, it’s come in handy now, hasn’t it? Are you glad
learned it?” Fleur asks.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
some ways. I’m happy to have the chance to dance with you. It is
not often I find a willing partner I like.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Though
plenty of willing partners who like you, I’m sure. I’m actually
quite amazed that you dance the man’s part so well. Is it hard to
switch roles in the waltz?” Fleur asks curiously.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Not
as hard as you’d think. Honestly, it feels natural,” Cy responds,
smiling softly at Fleur, who is distracted by something across the
room.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
think your mother would like us to stop, she’s waving us down at
the edge of the dancefloor. I suspect she wants you to speak to
another inquisitive client,” Fleur warns Cy.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Can
we ignore her? Please? I don’t want to stop now. I just got away
from the last lecherous client.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’m
afraid not. She does not look pleased. Come on then, give me a grand
final twirl to finish the dance and we can go our separate ways.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
obliges Fleur, albeit unhappily. As they slow their dance, he slips
her hand from his shoulder, curls her body in as close to his body as
possible, and then propels her away in an elegant, dramatic twist.
Their clasped hands form a final bridge before their dance ends. Then
Chir pulls Cy away.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
wakes up later to the feeling of bristles fanning his hair out,
across his pillow. In the dark of his bedroom, he can make out only
the silhouette of Chir sitting beside him. She smells of wine and
rose water.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
danced beautifully tonight,” Chir comments in a thoughtful tone.
“Odd that you should choose to dance with Fleur though. You two
have become close. It is rather disconcerting, don’t you think?
That a woman her age would dote on a young woman like you? Why do you
think that is?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
starts to prop himself up, but soon realizes something is wrong. His
brain implant seems to be malfunctioning. His arms are not responding
to his thoughts. Cy turns with confusion to check his prosthetics,
only to find the familiar gleam of metal replaced by empty shadows.
The bedside table, where his aluminum leg pieces should be, is empty.
There is no sign of his arms or legs. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cy
begins to panic. He struggles to move the nubs of his arms and legs,
and manages to contort himself in such a way to roll away from Chir,
toward the far edge of his mattress.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cygne,
don’t you see how helpless you are without me? Don’t you see what
I’ve done for you? The gifts I have given you? Do you think Fleur
would still be here to help you? Do you think she would still dote on
you?”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chir
stands, preventing Cy from rolling off the other side of the bed as
he struggles to get away from her. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Look
at yourself. Look at what you become without me to care for you,”
Chir takes a strong hold of Cy’s shoulder to roll him onto his
back. Then she holds up one of his aluminum arms above him. “This
is mine. You are mine. Don’t you see now? I own you. Without me,
you are nothing. Without me, you would die.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Glaring
up at Chir, Cy screams in frustration. He tries to turn his head and
bite her hand, but she lets his shoulder go quickly with a triumphant
smile. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Dropping
his head back onto the bed, Cy regards her coolly. “I am not your
daughter. It doesn’t matter what pills you force down my throat, or
the operations you perform on me. That bothers you, doesn’t it? I
will never be your perfect little swan.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chir
narrows her eyes. She doesn’t speak for a long time, and Cy thinks
she might be on the verge of tears, but Cy has never seen Chir cry.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
she finally responds, she stoops low over Cy and speaks in a low
hiss. “Don’t expect to see Fleur again, or anyone else for that
matter. Clearly, your behavior has demonstrated you are no longer fit
for public interaction. Such a shame.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chir
straightens then, and turns her back, leaving Cy amputated and
stranded on the bed. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; ">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
callous bitch! You’re heartless!” Cy yells after her. He
continues to scream long after she closes the door, until he exhausts
his voice.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
Cy emerges from his bedroom wearing the simple white dress, he
anticipates the knowing smile Chir will give him upon entering the
dining room downstairs. It is a look just as appraising as the
client’s, a look that lingers on his metallic prosthetics, his
scantily clad breasts, and the wires that embed into his skull. It is
a look that calculates just how much of him is metal, how much is
still warm, pliable skin, and how much of him she can sell to her
