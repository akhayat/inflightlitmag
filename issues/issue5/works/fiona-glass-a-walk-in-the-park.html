<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
was dark when Samuel left for work, and dark when he got home. At
least for six months of the year, between October and March, when the
long nights set in and you were lucky to get half a dozen hours of
greyish daylight beneath the clouds. It was his own stupid fault. The
six-thirty-seven got him to work too soon; it would have been easier
to have a lie-in, linger over breakfast, and catch a later bus. But
the only time he tried, it sat in the rush hour traffic like a bug in
lard and hardly moved. He was twenty minutes late and his colleagues
all made snotty remarks in loud whispers behind his back.</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">His
colleagues despised him enough at the best of times. Most of them
were under thirty and wore sharp suits and sharper shoes. They looked
down their sneering noses at his sports jacket with the leather elbow
patches and his comfy brogues. They couldn't do much about it,
though, because the office rules said 'jacket and tie', and that's
what he wore.</font></font></span></div>

<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Samuel
hated work. Thirty years ago he'd enjoyed the buzz, talking to the
customers and feeling that he was helping someone live a better life.
Now everything was computers and cell phones and he never spoke to
anyone face to face. He worked in a back room, shuffling bits of
paper round his desk and contacting faceless voices who rarely called
him back. Thirty years ago he'd worked shorter hours as well - nine
to five-thirty with an hour off for lunch - but now everything was
'meeting targets' and 'being a good team player' and they expected
you to work straight through. &nbsp;Samuel couldn't remember the last
time he'd left his desk for lunch, or walked to the local deli or
felt the fresh air on his face. The air in the office was stale,
recycled so often that every atom had died.&nbsp;Samuel's nose and
throat ached, and his eyes were red and tired. He missed the sunlight
on the trees, and the simple joy of walking through the streets.</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;Go
out somewhere at the weekends,&quot; his brother suggested when
Samuel grumbled to him.&nbsp;&quot;It's not as though you have to go
to work then.&quot;</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Samuel
tried that, but found he had no time for the chores.&nbsp;It was all
right for Al, who had a wife to do his washing and cooking while he
went to work. Samuel had been married once as well, but Ellie had run
off years ago, saying he was conventional and dull. &quot;You're no
</font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fun</i></font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,&quot;
she used to screech, whenever he didn't want to dance naked after
dark or swap wives or even husbands to keep up with her latest fad.
She'd married a travelling actor instead, and he'd last heard of her
in a caravan with six kids and a seventh on the way. He wasn't
normally a vindictive man, but he hoped she was having fun now.</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One
day the loudest sharp-suit had a go at him. &quot;You old fogeys are
holding the company back. We should fire the lot of you and go for
young blood instead. New ideas, new energy, new direction. You should
do the decent thing, Grandpa, and retire.&quot;</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Samuel
didn't say much back but he'd seen that happen before. His uncle's
company had booted out everyone over the age of forty-five, and
replaced them with Young Blood. For six months everything had been
fine, and then the company had started to go downhill. The Young
Bloods had no experience and couldn't work out what was wrong, and
the company had to re-hire the old hands (at a higher wage than
before) to come and fix the mess. </font></font></span>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
knew the sharp-suit was wrong, but that didn't stop the words from
cutting deep. He'd given the company thirty-eight years of his life
and this was the thanks he got.&nbsp;He'd not taken a day off in all
that time, but the next day he phoned in sick. His head hurt, his
vision swam, and the thought of being indoors with people in suits
nearly made him choke. Even though it was November and raining hard
he put on his oldest clothes - sandals and T-shirt and baggy cotton
pants - and didn't bother to shave. There was a park he remembered,
that his mother used to wheel him to when he was still in his pram.
The neighbourhood had changed, of course, but the park was still
there, if overgrown, and there was a subway station close by. When
the train stopped there he got out, climbed the stairs and stood
outside breathing in the air. It smelled of diesel and fries, but it
was still air - not something recycled out of a tube.</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
park was full of wet leaves that swirled round his ankles and stuck
to his legs. There were discarded needles, too, and the usual flotsam
of empty bottles and spoiling food, including half a pie the pigeons
were battling for. Samuel ignored the mess and stepped away from the
path. The grass hadn't been cut in a while and was half buried in
leaves. He took off his sandals and wriggled his toes in the long wet
stems. The rain still pelted down, soaking him from head to foot, and
he was cold. &nbsp;But the earth felt good beneath his feet and the
air smelled of leaves and the promise of next year's growth, and
Samuel was happy for the first time in years.</font></font></span></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; "><span style="background: transparent"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
it</i></font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
he thought. </font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
never going back indoors.</i></font></font><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
He found a bench and a newspaper someone had thrown away, and settled
himself down. The ranger found him next morning, where he'd quietly
frozen to sleep.</font></font></span></div>
