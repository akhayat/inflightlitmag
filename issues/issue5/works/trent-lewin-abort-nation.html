<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
do not have a name. Arch Stanton is a name I heard once, late at
night, and decided to keep. It may be my name someday. But I cannot
speak, and when I leave this place, I do not know if I can articulate
my preference to the world; more than likely, a name will be selected
for me, and that will be that.</font></font></div>

am remiss. I heard the word “remiss” on a tv show, and I believe
that it is a lame word. But I understand the meaning, and I know that
I am remiss, for I am not four years old: I am four months old.</font></font></div>

this stage of my life, I can dream.  I have dreams. They are of cars
and cocaine. They are warnings against what will happen if I take the
one while driving the other.  I hear these prohibitions through the
water that surrounds me, and through the skin over top of that.  </font></font>

<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
can think. You don’t believe this. You don’t believe that I can
dream of cars. And of getting high – such disbelief! as you drive
down the street, getting high while driving your Durango, plowing
into some kid that had the fortune of being born.  But I can dream. I
can think.  I can feel pain. I can even drink. If my mother downs a
half a bottle of wine, I am drunk. I have bed spins. I may even
vomit. I feel it all.</font></font></div>

I cannot write, I can make lists. I have enough cranial capacity to

born:</font></font></div>

<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
have not gotten any further than that as yet. Oh, forgot, I would
like to see the ending to the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Lord
of the Rings</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
trilogy. My mother sat through most of it but fell asleep at the end.
What happened to that little guy and his ring? I have no idea.  </font></font>

<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
am Arch Stanton. I am now five; five months, and please don’t get
confused again. I have eyebrows now. But only on one side. I have
testicles, too, but they are indistinguishable from my asshole. I
long for tit. I want to suck nipples. When I go to sleep, I dream of
sucking tit. It’s like I was born for that – well, not that I
have been born, but you know what I mean. I got a penis yesterday. It
is very small. I tried to masturbate when it appeared, but this
didn’t work out well. Not enough structural reinforcement in the
muscle tone to let me have a proper go of it.</font></font></div>

</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Listen,
today I heard a rumour. You don’t believe that I can hear, no more
than you can believe that I want a girlfriend some day, that I will
be good to her and that she will leave me. But I can hear.  My mother
doesn’t want me. Doesn’t want the pain. Doesn’t want the
burden. Doesn’t want the life that will come out with me and stain
her all over, make her unbeautiful, make her old, make her unwanted.
She doesn’t want me. That’s okay. No one wants me. I know all
about your world.  Muslims are evil. Climate is changing. Shit is
happening. Why would you want a baby to come into this world,
especially when you are a female and you want to do your meth freely,
and then curl underneath your baby blanket when you finally get back
to your apartment? And oh yeah, why would you want a baby brought
into a world when you were raped three times in six weeks, by three
different guys who took care of you when you were drunk – and by
extension, when I was drunk?  And none of those rapists are even my
dad.  </font></font>

am a man and probably will be raped if I am born, too. That is the
way of it. There are penises in here with me all the time. Some are
short. Some are long. Some are thin. Some are thick. They are all not
my father. I remember him. He is a characteristic dick. I never saw
him again. He is making babies somewhere else. Good babies.
Self-aware children that he will take care of, because I know he is a
good man: he was just not ready, and how can that be held against
him? These are circumstances at play, like badgers or beavers, a type
of rodent that scurries about unprepared for life until it finally
bashes into a wall and realizes that it is growing old smoking all
those cigars in the beaver lodge – that it had better do something,
become calm, remain even, learn to love, learn to have children and
keep them for once. All I ever saw of my father was his dick.  But I
love the guy, wherever he is.</font></font></div>

</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
is now two days since I got my penis and tried to jerk off. The prick
of a syringe touches my hamstring as my mom talks to a doctor about
how much easier her life will be without me. I love her most of all.
She took care of me. Fed me. Touched me. Let me hear music. She
tried. But she has it much worse off than my father: she’s stuck
with the detritus of life that is growing within her own body, stuck
with the possibility of taking care of me by herself. How is that
fair?</font></font></div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><br><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
syringe delivers a chemical that smells foul. It makes me slow. It
stops my dreams. It slackens my limbs. It steps across a border;
opens a front door; smells Christmas; bakes bread; walks on the moon.
This, your majesty, your highness, is death. This is what it is like
to die when you are five months old. This is what you presume, that I
cannot feel what is coming – but just because I cannot fight for my
life does not mean that I cannot call you out for taking it away from
me.</font></font></div>

chemical denudes my flesh. Stops it. But you did not use enough. When
the pincers come in to take me out, I am still alive. I slip out and
for a moment, see the world. But I am only five months old, and my
body does not properly work. I see my mother. I see the doctor. I am
upside down, hanging by my right leg as the pincers dig in and crush
my bones, and someone cuts off the connection I have with my mother.
After that, I am dark. I am done.</font></font></div>

put me in a bag and label me. They do not use the name “Arch

devices and fat woman blubber extracted by a hose not much different
than the thing that used to connect me to my mother. Someone whispers
something about a furnace, and a burning: a flame that will
incinerate me, Arch Stanton, as medical waste – that is the only
route I have to Heaven. The only one.</font></font></div>

in the streets. You feed normal people with shit so toxic that they
are going to die young. You let Africans starve. You pump people full
of chemicals they don’t need. You spew particulates into the
atmosphere that kill the very young and the very old. You
mass-produce cigarettes, knowing they have no safe level of use. You
kill Presidents. You hang despots. You do all these things, again and
again and again and again. And so why, in the end, well, why </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wouldn’t</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
