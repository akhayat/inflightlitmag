<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">God
finished developing a cure for cancer in the backyard lab late one
night. &nbsp;The calendar on the wall was full; it would be 2022
until the cure could be unveiled on Earth, for in between were
floods, elevated sea levels, and one very nasty dirty nuclear bomb
incident. &nbsp;The decade ahead was going to be busy.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">God
was tired and sat in a recliner. &nbsp;A burnt out star served as
dinner; an ocean of sulphur was a bedtime drink. &nbsp;Leaning
against the bed, God prayed, words in a thousand languages that had
the voice of the Father, the Mother, and the Others, those who had
imagined the Heavens and then gone to them. &nbsp;But God did not
sleep; eyes that had seen the bellies of supernovas remained open as
a roof made of purple clouds moiled overhead.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">God
sighed. &nbsp;And when time moved, there was Earth again – Earth of
1468. &nbsp;And God stood on a stream bank, hiding behind a poplar,
as a woman walked along the other shore. &nbsp;Her name was Alaine,
and she trod the route with a basket of apples. &nbsp;Today was warm.
&nbsp;Today, the sun immolated her hair and bled blue from her eyes.
&nbsp;Her only flaw was her teeth, which were crooked and starting to
rot; otherwise, she was more glorious than anything that flew the
skies or swam the seas or crawled through the tunnels of space. &nbsp;For
God, a hundred visitations had passed behind the shade of the poplar;
in that time, a new sun had formed and planets had begged for
creation. &nbsp;And yet in all that time, God had remained hidden
from Alaine. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Today,
God finally stepped from the shadows and went to her. &nbsp;She put
down the basket of apples and said something across the water as God
stepped over the rocks. &nbsp;It would have been easy to modulate the
function of Alaine’s mind, to implant there the wonder of the God
that held her hands, that drew her close, that lay lips upon hers.
&nbsp;But God resisted, and merely spoke the uncertain poetry that
had been practiced on the other side of the moon where no one would
hear the words – would hear the halting uncertainty of the prayer.
&nbsp;In the sunlight, the words came and Alaine's blue eyes bled
light. &nbsp;Skin pressed close, voices fled. &nbsp;And the only time
God interceded was when a cloud threatened to block the sunlight, but
a wave of the hand turned the vapour into drops of atom, and when the
sun returned, God was atop Alaine, precious Alaine, beautiful Alaine,
naked on the sand of the stream bank, clutching God’s back as her
legs shifted, her body dug into the bank until water streamed into
the depression. &nbsp;Alaine cried as she asked for God’s name; but
poetry was good enough to answer her, always was the equal of stars
and how they came to be, and will suffice when stars cease to be.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">That
night, God slept. &nbsp;Dreams of Alaine were mixed with draughts of
sulphur. &nbsp;A star collapsed too early, but God knew nothing of
it.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
morning shone, and God worked with chisel and hammer to perfect a
statue in honour of the Father. &nbsp;A million years were not enough
to finish the work, but God laid down the tools when the morning upon
Earth began. &nbsp;Alaine walked the stream bank. &nbsp;Today, her
eyes searched the poplars, and she waited in the stream to see if God
would come. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Resist,”
scribbled God in a diary. &nbsp;With a pencil nub made of a
meteorite, God wrote the reasons, the “only a mortal” followed by
“she will cease” and the “you could change it, you could free
her, you could bring her here if she wanted, she could live, she
could go on, she could be by your side forever if only you were
brave”; but those writings broke as the meteorite snapped, and
after that came the reality, the unattainable things, the “Father
would not approve”, and the “Mother would never allow a mortal to
touch you…”, and then the final point that stood in the way, the
one that both would enunciate as they stood shocked at the doorway to
the cosmos, looking upon God’s choice. &nbsp;“Mother, Father,”
wrote God, until the meteorite degraded into stardust, “is this so
wrong that you must concern yourselves with it from Heaven?” &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">God
went to Alaine again anyway. &nbsp;God stood in the poplars, and
could find no ache in space to stand in the way of how Alaine cried
when she saw God striding from the shadows, how Alaine ran across the
stream to hold God, to kiss God, to have God underneath the branches
as birds sang the words of poets and moons. &nbsp;God went to her.
&nbsp;Again and again, though the folds of Heaven roiled with anger,
God went to her.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
then a world of creatures in the farthest stretches of space’s
expansion took God’s attention away. &nbsp;The filthy beasts
crashed at each other in a war that spat clouds so thick against
their sun that God coughed in passing through the haze. &nbsp;God
stood on a mountaintop, watching the carnage, judging it while
allowing it, seeking for any spark of redemption, any sign that
salvation was forthcoming for these creatures. &nbsp;&quot;Father,
Mother,&quot; prayed God, &quot;is she so wrong before this? &nbsp;Is
she so aberrant in the face of this sickness?&quot; &nbsp;God stayed
upon the mountaintop, the prayer a song of salvation that was heard
by so few; and yet God did not move until the song was finished. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
Earth, two years had passed. &nbsp;Alaine walked in the morning but
God waited and watched, and that night saw Alaine speaking God’s
poetry again, this time in the arms of a bearded man who kept her
within a wooden hut and made promises to her that were so much
smaller than what God had brought. &nbsp;This man spoke no poetry.
&nbsp;This man had no grace. &nbsp;This man bid Alaine close her lips
so that Alaine’s rotting teeth were hidden; and then he took the
rest of her, claimed it all. &nbsp;God could have disintegrated him
instantly, could have wiped the memory of him from all humanity,
could have eradicated the echo of him from the universe altogether.
&nbsp;Yet God watched the writhing of limbs before the sooty
fireplace. &nbsp;God listened to every word and sound. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
a bolt of light, God streaked to the fringes of the universe, where
the first matter had gone to age and expire. &nbsp;There, God
destroyed. &nbsp;Planets erupted, stars contracted into shards of
gravity, and nearby galaxies shuddered before the chaos. &nbsp;When
God twisted the physics of reality, the universe shook; and though
this was pleasing to God, a rumbling in Heaven started in that
moment, the distant din of the Father and the Mother. &nbsp;God went
to the purple clouds that night and drank of sulphur and starwine;
and that night, God dreamt of nothing, not even of Alaine.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
next day, God grew a beard. &nbsp;God fashioned a trident. &nbsp;God
went to the lab and created a creature designed to penetrate the
mists between this universe and the Heavens where the Others had
gone. &nbsp;But God strayed, for God watched Alaine on the stream
bank with her basket of apples. &nbsp;God could have struck her down.
&nbsp;God could have filled her heart with regret and shame for what
she had done, such shame that she would have lived alone the rest of
her years with the ache of it. &nbsp;But in the end, God watched her
sleep, and as she dreamed, God visited her a final time. &nbsp;When
Alaine awoke, she went to the stream, and when she bent down to wash
her face of grime and dirt, she found that her smile gleamed with the
perfection of a thousand diamonds.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
night, God prayed to the Father and the Mother and the Others too.
&nbsp;Heaven roiled far away, and God strode the universe alone,
alone but for memories and poetry, the Brothers gone, the Sisters
too, those who had comforted Her long ago. &nbsp;Long ago, when She
had been born, when She had dreamed of love and then created it, when
She had loved a mortal and then tried to forget it. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">God
soared through space. &nbsp;It was 1791; it was 2006; it was the
future and the past, and She had work to do on the fabric of the
cosmos. &nbsp;&nbsp;But at nights, She went to the lab and chiseled
at the statue of the Father, and then She worked on the creature that
She hoped would find a way through to Heaven. &nbsp;And sometimes, as
She worked, She made words that sounded like poetry; and without
knowing it, a few of Her words floated past the purple clouds into a
place that Heaven could not see, where judgment is just a word, there
to create a world where no one yet lives.</font></font></div>
