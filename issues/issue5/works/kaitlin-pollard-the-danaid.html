<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr">
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
finds her naked, collapsed on the floor, curled onto her side, like a
child. The blades of her shoulders jut sharp against the pale of her
skin, and he can trace the shadows her ribs cast in the mounting
light of dawn. She’s breathing, but only barely. The perfunctory
rise and fall of her form strikes him as a sordid motion, a
distraction from the languid elegance of her body on the floor. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
he crouches down to touch her, she feels cold, unmoving. His hand
traces a line down her side, resting on the burl of her hip. He
imagines the bare layers of fat and muscle that pad the bone just
under his hand, forming a womanly curve for her body where otherwise
there would be only sharp angles and hard lines. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Judging
from her sprawled pose, he guesses she woke in the middle of the
night and slipped from the bedroom without waking him. Fatigue
overtakes her much faster now than it did before, she must have
stopped in the hall before she could reach the kitchen or living
room. He wonders how long she waited in the hall, grasping for lost
energy, lost strength that had yet to return. Cold and weary, she
must have fallen asleep before she could call for him, if she planned
to call for him at all. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Despite
the chill of her naked skin, she looks comfortable sprawled on the
floor. Maybe this is where she intended to sleep all along. Maybe, if
he asked, she would tell him to leave her alone, but he won’t ask.
He wouldn’t have the strength to leave her.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
brushes a hand over the strands of ink black hair where it has pooled
under her head. Cold as her body, cold as the floor under bare feet,
the silken spun strands smell of coconut oil. The smell permeates
every room of the house, now that she finds herself house bound. He
imagines that while he is gone, she spends her empty hours rubbing
the pale oil into her hair, her skin, every surface of her body. He
knows how she likes to rub her wasting muscles, monitoring the
deterioration with shaking hands and a softening grip. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
recent months, she has opted to spend her days naked, in part to lift
the burden of clothes from her form. But she also gazes at her body,
reclined on the bed, reclined on the couch, reclined in the bath.
It’s as though she’s studying the process of deterioration,
trying to pinpoint the exact motion of her sickness as it wears down
her muscles and breaks down the fibers of her existence. Sometimes,
he catches himself watching for it too. But it’s inexplicable.
Inexplicable and inescapable, and for a short time, the test results
meant nothing more than the occasional spasm or misstep. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Watching
her eerily still body, counting each slight breath, he mourns that
time, which is long in the past. He wedges his hands under her cold
body, adjusts the weight to balance in the crook of his elbows, and
frowns when she does not immediately wake upon the shift of her body
into his arms. Her head lolls limp to the side, revealing her lips,
cracked dry and tinted blue from the cold. As he watches, with alarm
growing like a crack in his chest, the muscles of her face gradually
pull into a grimace. She groans rough and low, but manages to open
one hazel eye. He supports her head to make it easier for her to look
at him. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Water?”
she asks.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
nods, carrying her to the couch where she can lounge under a thick
pile of blankets. Before he stops in the kitchen, he tucks her
carefully into her nest. He turns her electric blanket on high,
hoping to rid her lips of their horrible blue tint, hoping that it is
not oxygen deprivation, hoping that a trip to the hospital emergency
room is not written in the stars for the day. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
returns from the kitchen with two glasses of water and a handful of
her medications. She grimaces at the sight, as though he would
forget.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Where’s
my spoonful of sugar?” she asks, joking.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’m
right here,” he responds, with a weak smile. It is a joke they came
up with in the beginning, when she laughed without wheezing. Now,
when she struggles to find the strength to smile, he wonders how they
ever found any humor in this.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
takes twenty minutes to go through her morning pill regimen. She
struggles to swallow the large pills, and the small pills dissolve on
her tongue, leaving a bitter taste. He waits to help her finish the
first glass of water before he gives her the television remote and he
leaves to take a shower.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
the steam, he thinks about her. Before she found out about the
disease, before she let him kiss her in the cab of his old pickup,
before she wrote her number on the back of a cocktail napkin at the
Joe’s old bar. Even then, she smelled of coconut oil, and her pale
skin captured the glow of the bar lights. When she stopped at the
bar, waiting for another round of shots for herself and her friends,
she resembled a statue brought to life. She looked to be carved by
Rodin himself. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
was glorious, a piece to behold and admire. Back then, he thought of
himself as weight she carried begrudgingly. Not quite clever enough,
not quite handsome enough, not quite bright enough to match her. No,
it was his hands, testing the boundaries of her pale skin, searching
out possibilities her body withheld for the future. And now, he
begrudges the cyclical nature of life, with the hot stream of water
soothing the strain of his back, that he must carry her weight for
her. </font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Still
not enough, he thinks, because he always carries the doubt that she
never chose to stay. How could she, when she had no choice at all?<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
