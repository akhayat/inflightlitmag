<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
was a Thursday afternoon in Spring, close to Easter. The snow had
long melted and there had been no rain for the first time in ages.
Everything outside was suddenly filling up with buds and turning
green. I was five and I could hear my friends, the brothers from
downstairs, already outside and playing noisily in our vast, shared
washing green. I stopped mobilising my soldiers on the rough El
Alamein battle terrain that I had created on my bed covers, and
hurried through to the living room to talk to my Gran.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
was sitting in the large cushioned armchair into which she fitted
exactly, like a formula one driver in his customised cockpit. The one
difference being that he can’t sit with his legs open so you can’t
actually see the long knickers under his skirt. My Gran was busy
knitting another blue jumper for me to wear to school because I had
grown again and the sleeves of the old one were riding up my arms,
making me look like an orangutan. She was dressed in tweed, buttoned
brown wool and puffy blue slippers, counting rows and listening to
Mrs Dales Diary on the radio. The sun was shining onto the rug in
front of her, split into dust-filled rays by the chimney pots on the
roof next door. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
leant against the doorway quietly, to let her finish her counting,
her lips moving with the numbers. She got to one hundred and ten then
looked up and smiled. ‘What are you up to wee Eddie?’</font></font></font></div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
quickly compiled my best case. ‘The boys are playing out the back
and the sun is shining so can I go outside?’</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">‘<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I’ll
boys you’, she said, in that senseless way that Scottish
grandparents seemed to regard as being perfectly sensible. Such as
they might say, ‘I’ll give you bike!’, when I wanted to go out
on my bike or, ‘You’ll be laughing on the other side of your
face’, when they thought that I was sniggering at the wrong time or
at the wrong people. I never knew how you could laugh on the other
side of your face and it became one of life’s unanswered questions.
&nbsp;My Gran and her friends were supreme mistresses of this
mysterious linguistic form and so I lost heart.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Then,
surprisingly, she relented. ‘Yes you probably need some fresh air
so you can go out for a couple of hours, until tea time’, she
answered, but with a stern tone in her voice. ‘But put on your cord
trousers and your black coat with the hood.’</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
knew this would happen. The boys never wore their coats in the
Spring, when the sun was out and they would be wearing their jeans,
jeans that my Gran considered to be too thin for rolling around in
the wet grass. So I would go out looking like the weak child, the
infirm child, the child who had to be helped out of his wheelchair
and not knocked over by the others. I became very conscious of
wearing the family frown, the one inherited from my Grampa’s side
of the family.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">My
Gran put her knitting down on her lap with an exasperated sigh and
gave me her own family’s famous frown. ‘You can frown all you
like and if you would rather stay inside that’s fine with me. But
if you want to go and play with your pals then it’s the brown cords
and your coat.’</font></font></font></div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
was obviously absolutely outrageous. ‘But Gran, the boys aren’t
wearing coats and they’ve got their jeans on. It’s nice and warm
now and I’ll look daft. And I’ll keep off the grass.’ The last
sentence was as far as I had got in my life negotiating skills
course.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Gran’s
expression changed from a frown to a cold, hard stare. ‘I don’t
care what the boys are wearing, they could be out there running
around naked if their mother allowed them to. I care about you not
catching another one of your Spring colds. You remember them, the
ones that you always catch at this time of year and take weeks to
clear? The ones that start in your nose then go up into your head,
then down into your throat then even further down into your chest.
Maybe you like all that medicine after all, the nasal spray, the ear
drops, the TCP that you so enjoy gargling, the hot sticky, smelly
kaylene poultices that you love to wear and then staying in bed with
nothing to do for two weeks. Is that what you want? No, so you can
either do what you’re told or stay inside.’</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">During
my Gran’s tirade I tasted, smelled and felt each one of these
dreadful, soul-destroying tortures, especially the horrible gargling
of TCP and the kaylene poultices which were like having a boiling hot
towel, covered in quick-dry cement, plastered onto my chest. My Gran
was right and I had no rational answer. I seemed indeed to be
significantly weaker than my three pals, who could probably have run
around all winter naked without any ill effect, while I always caught
the cold around Easter for exactly the same reason; not enough
clothes. </font></font></font>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
some people still say, annoyingly, ‘Ne’er cast a clout ‘till
May be out’ or, keep your cords and coat on until the first of
June, no matter how deep the humiliation.</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">So,
of course, having run out of intelligent arguments, I lost my temper
and heard myself yelling, ‘Ha! And I thought that the Mackays were
a sensible family!’ Then I ran back to my room while my Gran
struggled to climb out of her comfortable chair gasping, ‘You
cheeky we Turk…!’</font></font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
eventually caught up with me, as angry as I’d ever seen her.
However, I was smart enough to know that only my Gran made my meals
around here, washed my clothes and cleaned my face when I was sick.
So by the time she staggered into the room, wearing only one slipper,
I was making a real effort to zip those tight corduroy trousers up
all by myself.</font></font></font></div>
<div style=" line-height: 100%"><font color="#000000">‘<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Just
as well’, she smiled and nodded in victory. ‘Just as well. Ah’m
just the wee wuman fur ye right enough.’ Of course I didn’t know
what that meant either.</font></font></font></div>
