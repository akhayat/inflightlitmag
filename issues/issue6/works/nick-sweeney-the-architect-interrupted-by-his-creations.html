wall-eyed boy stands in my doorway. I don’t know how long he has
been there. I think how without the scale dictated by the doorway, he
would look like no boy at all; could be a colossus, or an
insect.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“What do you want?” The timbre of my voice surprises me.
Sometimes I must resist a mania to repeat utterances, just to make
sure the voice is my own. I ask again, and the boy steps
in.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have a recollection of him lifting his head from his food, looking
like a metal automaton depicting a lizard. I was the only one at the
table who saw this. I started out of my chair, and they all looked at
me when I pointed, saying, “Can he be switched off?” </font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a racing car spread out over my reception room. Its frame
and parts are like those of some magnificent beast reduced to
dissection.&nbsp; What kind of boy would look so pointedly at me,
when he could be marvelling over an Amilcar from the future past –
it is the very same Amilcar sports model whose wheel broke the neck
of dancer Isadora Duncan when she caught her foolish scarf in its
delicate spokes. I could point out to the boy that it was only then
that she achieved the pure classical form she had sought all her
life, and sometimes in the chrome I see her image as still and
perfect as the Winged Nike from the island of Samothrace, and as
broken.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
boy raises a thumb to cue a wedding band wheezing into the afternoon.
Outside on the square, tenement crones raise eyes, trying to see the
music. </font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Why
bother</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
I want to call. Heralds in yellow velvet and white lace turn into the
square, themselves heralded by a fog of mosquitoes, some of whom will
find their way under bridal veils, waistcoats and eyelids, and into
photos. The camera will freeze them in their bloodlust, taking their
place in all time, here in Trievo.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
tourists used to ooh and aah about the light in Trievo. They didn’t
realise, though, that light is no good unless it falls on brick,
stone, glass, metal; it is only these that give the light any
property. You can’t look at beauty without this backdrop of hard
materials, products of toil and fire, and the will that forced them
into being. People don’t get married in churches because they are
in awe of God; they marry there for the photos, and a share of the
light.&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
afternoon, that light rests on the starkest features of what during
the war was known as the Avenue of Painted Women; these are the
bricked-in windows of the </font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>casa
grande</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
originally belonging to the Medici, though I suspect that its sole
inhabitant was Gandolfo Medici, referred to usually as ‘the
Unfortunate’. After displaying his madness in his teens, he was
sent to Trievo in the hope that death would claim him before he could
claim his inheritance. He frittered away a lot of it all the way to
the age of thirty, though, when the mosquitoes annoyed him into
stepping off the roof into a different oblivion.&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

grande </i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">found
its way into our family. Some say that Gandolfo Medici’s seed also
found its way there, but I’m not so sure of that; our mild madness
is one-toned and even, lacks the Medici stamp of
savagery.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Commentators talk about the mosquitoes, and the stagnant air in
summer, the threat of plague that keeps the tourists away in,
presumably, their millions. They talk about acquaintances foolish
enough to croak their last summers away here, talk with awe of
whatever detained them in the graveyard outside the Byzantine walls,
insect bites, rat bites, or just the pale yellow mist immediately
before sunset, which comes down the streets like mustard gas, chased
merrily by black clouds of biting insects. The chattering classes
document Trievo in the travel supplements, and yatter about its
beauty, yet dare one another to pass a week here.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was the plague that killed my Roman ancestors. One of the
satirists wrote a verse about the town abandoned to the sickness of
sleep, and nobody alive to collect the dead. He traced the fire that
ruined all that lay inside the walls to the last man alive, a baker
busy making funeral cakes up to the moment when he heard a buzzing in
his ears and felt his vision dim, and called to his dead wife that he
was quite unwell, quite, quite unwell, and that he was going to lie
down and take a – .</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That’s nature given free rein for you. But it’s nothing without
architecture. Without towers, there is no point in looking at the
sky. Without walls, and the apertures cut into them, there is really
no point to light; without roofs, no majesty or cruelty in winter, no
places in which to wrap up and linger in bed; no joy in frost if it
doesn’t cover the protective skin of glass.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without
the mosquito clouds of summer, my father Don Argento would never have
made his fortune from his research into that noble little
bloodsucker, his publications that keep those tourists out to the
ruin of would-be restauranteurs and peddlers of souvenirs; even the
pickpockets have to take working holidays to graduate. With no
mosquitoes, Don Argento would never have passed that fortune on to me
when he got bitten by one too many of the opportunistic little
beasts, and died yellow and shaking.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
I came back from my travels, Don Argento never wanted to know what I
had seen, nor about who I had met. “The world is a bad and corrupt
place,” he would state. “And you have become a bad and corrupt
man. You will stay here,” he commanded, when the time came for me
to seek out the world again. He sent his servants after me. At the
station, they beat me and kicked me till my teeth shook, but they
could never hold me.&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don
Argento left me his money, but he shrank my world; one condition,
enshrined in a codicil policed by curtain-twitching lawyers, was that
I give up on that world, and keep to my home in
Trievo.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a time before that, I made towers rise out of southern hemisphere
hellhole cities, commissioned by dictators with money to burn. They
are now filled with the remnants of banks and businesses whose
financial whizzkids fled or were butchered. I raised follies in an
absurd Italianate town in the east of Europe, and made a monument to
the dead of world wars. Their voices sang to me over the sound of
diggers, in gratitude, I thought in my vanity, but they were really
screaming out the frustration of those who fought to have a fair
world built around them, instead of some chunk of
masonry.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
built an opera house in a minor northern city. I met the Duce, was
held steady in the blank-eyed gaze of a fat child. I fashioned the
shell for him, went back for the first night, saw the place ruined
with plush and perfume. A diva had to restrain me from going up to
the nation’s brother and yelling, “I brought you the future, and
what have you done? You’ve turned it into the past.” But that was
the paradox of Mussolini: he was a nineteenth century man, shoving
our country into the twentieth century at the point of a revolver. As
a young man, I didn’t respect paradox – it was an eccentric,
Greek way of looking at the world. I was out in that world as a
Roman. The diva gripped my shoulders as I watched the leader declare
the place open by leaning from his seat and barking at the musicians,
“Now, play!” I was saddened to see him at the opera, in his dress
suit and spiv spats, his bowler hat on his podgy knees.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
liked the diva’s hands on my shoulders. I screwed her in a hallway
to the twee sound of Mozart, made her sing just for me. I told her
how the only way Mozart could be improved would be to add a hundred
roaring motorbikes to his toodlings. I felt a current between us. In
this way I forgot about the Duce and how he had worked the impossible
with the force of his petulant, child’s will, worked his wishes on
the world. And on my opera house. The shadow of my jealousy came back
to me next morning like a hangover, and I remembered the diva telling
me that the Duce had screwed her first, and had screwed her quicker –
not a man who liked to hang around – and
better.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesmerised
by the gleam of my father’s fortune, I forgot the world. It was
easier to forget than Don Argento’s servants. One of them followed
Gandolfo Medici off the roof while searching for a nightingale whose
song had been keeping me awake. The other had an incident with a
fruit cake that contained ground glass; he didn’t have to eat the
whole thing. Actually, he did. I was holding a pistol to his head at
the time.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
revenge out of the way, I was able to concentrate on the finer
things. After working my disdain for them out on the drawings with a
stiletto, I fixed belfries in Siena, baptisteries in Ravenna,
balconies in Verona, columns in Rome, towers in Pisa, secret passages
in Salo. I made churches safe for gangsters and communicants and
black-clad crones who scratch you with their yellow nails if you dare
to take their front row seats on days when the saint’s dusty blood
is liquefied in a vial.&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Trievo, the remains of the structures that awed the populace in their
hovels still stand, testimony to the agile skill of the architect in
the service of power. Arches present their light and shade, as do
long arcades; columns and towers cast shadows, and monumental
walkways seem to float in the air; the white stone is blackened here
and there, monogrammed, numbered, graffitied with the marks of
emperors down through senators, prefects, mayors, civil servants,
fascists, communists, scooter boys, football hooligans. The market is
said to have been built by a fondly remembered emperor, even though
he was two at the time it was raised; people would rather remember
him for markets he didn’t build than for the cack-handed battles he
fought, or the time he blinded, raped and killed his sister in a fit
of drunken melancholy. The steam-streaked walls of the baths stand
too, where men were men and boys were nervous, where laughter rang
out from some while others, by imperial decree, sat in tubs in the
background and opened the veins in their wrists, eyes raised to see
the goddesses. All the structures form a labyrinth leading to a
triumphal way, that leads in turn to the marble pool once full of
sacred carp, now the traffic roundabout.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
make the steam for the baths, of course, what did my ancestors do?
Swanky with their empire, and their manifestos from the gods, they
cut down every tree for a hundred-mile radius. They laid the swamps
bare, laid the town open to clouds of mosquitoes, odours,
vapours.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
town council wanted me to fix it all up at one time, had big blue
plans drawn up, and parchment contracts, ridiculous wax seals at the
ready. It would be Trievo’s fortune; people would flood in to see
this jewel from the classical world. I saw the gaudy crowds outside
for a second. They were so real I was about to throw the window up
and tell them all to fuck off home. I suggested enclosing the whole
town in chrome. The councillors looked at me. One of them commented,
“It might be a little slippery in the rain,” and some of them
tittered. They didn’t get it: they too would be under the chrome. I
was giving them the futurist’s Pompeii, and what were they thinking
of? The weather, like English grandmothers wondering if they ought to
walk their dogs.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember the boy. He is standing in my doorway under my carving of
the Virgin of the Sancta Sofia disguised as Josephine Baker.
</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“What?” I ask him.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Papa.” He hands me a note. I know when he speaks that it is from
his mother. I open it and read the words, </font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Allright,
allright Iago, you are a very, very faithful man</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
I frown at the repetitions of words that say it all when used
once.&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She’s been at her Shakespeare again,” I tell the boy. He
copies my frown. “Does she want an answer?” He doesn’t know.
“Do you know what it means?” I ask, and when he looks puzzled I
show him the note. He shakes his head with the frankness of children.
“I don’t know what it means, either.” I take money out of
pockets, and give some to him, feel his eyes on me. “What are you
looking at?” I tease him gently, and he shakes his head again,
looks at the floor, but I know.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My yellowed lizard eyes, and the scales covering black bruises that
show under my skin, he sees; the clothes that hang off my frame, the
sickness that picks at me but refuses to consume me.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My metal bird lurches on its metal perch in its metal cage, and tries
to sing. It needs oil, though; it sounds as if it is choking.
Mercifully, it comes to a rusty halt. My look invites the boy to
laugh, but the only change in his face is the emergence of his dry
tongue, which rests at the side of his mouth.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Go,” I tell him. “And give my love to your mother and remind
her that, as usual, I haven’t got a clue what she’s talking
about.”</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Thank you, Papa.” He bows his head, and is so eager to leave
that he runs into a small girl in the doorway. She is dressed for
tenement Sunday, and has wedding confetti in her hair. She brushes
the boy aside with the early disdain of a lady, and stands, patient,
waiting for me to invite her in. I remember her – I think it was
her – the one who liked to sit in corners and doze and dream, and
one time when I watched her eyelids flickering I saw behind them the
red sheen of molten lead. All I see now though is her white wall eye,
almost fixed on me, then I spy the note clutched in her hand from her
mother, and reach into my pockets. </font></font></font>
