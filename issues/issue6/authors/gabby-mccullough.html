McCullough was born of scrawled ink blotched onto a paper, pieced
together by inane scribblings and word doodles. Enchanted with the
idea of entrapping emotions into meaningful squiggles, she employs
written word as a refuge, penning pain neatly into discrete units
which, once united, ultimately explicate. Clemens is fascinated by
the role of the writer, unable to decide whether phrases are created
and conjured by a writer, or whether a scribe is merely a conduit of
predestined vocals waiting in the shadows to be birthed in scripted
speech, never abandoning the possibility that the truth lies in a
tumultuous marriage between the two. Her favorite pairing of words is
the bittersweet utterance “asinine invocation,” which she
believes encapsulates the miserable hope which propagates the human
condition.</font></font></div>
