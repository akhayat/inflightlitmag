hails from a mining town near Sheffield, England and has a difficulty
describing herself honestly. Currently she is studying English
Literature and Creative Writing in Cambridge and working part-time to
fuel her spiraling obsession with Apple Capri Suns. She is trying to
maintain the balance of studying and experiencing and so far is not
doing so well. Keeley likes a lot of things that she'll probably grow
tired of soon so she won't mention just in case they come back to
bite her.</font></font></div>
