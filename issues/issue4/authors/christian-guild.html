Guild is an eighteen-year-old young adult who has been inspired by
poetry and religion. Each of which are beautiful in their own
respects.&nbsp;He plans to major in theology and continue on to
get a PhD in Comparative Religion or New Testament.&nbsp;He has
self-published two books including &quot;The Beginnings&quot; and
&quot;Sproutings&quot;. Some say his poems are contemporary, some say
his poems are nonsense, and even some say they understand the poems!
But, he doesn't care on how they are viewed as long as they make an
impact on someone's life.</font></font></div>
