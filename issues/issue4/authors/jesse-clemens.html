Clemens lives in Los Angeles, CA, and is currently pursuing an M.A.
in English/Creative Writing from California State University,
Northridge. He was born and raised as an Angeleno, and tirelessly
fights against the apathetic forces that think LA is lame. He is an
INFJ on the Meyers-Briggs scale, so if he leaves right in the middle
of an intense conversation to go huddle in a dark corner and read,
please don't be alarmed; this is <i>normal</i>. He is rarely found
not eating tacos.</font></font></div>
