Cameron is a resident of Spokane, Washington, a studier and maker of
language, and an avid lover  of birds (though with great disdain for
crows).  Born in eastern Montana to a Scottish family, his
investments primarily concern that of calligraphy, poems, and the
Chinese fiddle – two of which have grown somewhat bearable to hear.
His international experiences remain limited to that of Scotland,
England, Holland, and Japan, though he should like to one day visit
Italy, or Spain, or most anywhere – ideally, finding a peaceful
hole there in which to spend the remainder of his days quite happily.</font></font></font></div>
