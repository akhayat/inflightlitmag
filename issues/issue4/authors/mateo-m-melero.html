Melero is a journalist who has worked for NBC and several community
publications throughout his career and dabbles with poetry from time
to time. He graduated from California State University, Northridge in
the spring of 2015 with a degree in journalism and a minor in
creative writing. His poetry tends to focus on social issues and
cultural dissonance. Sometimes he has a twang to his voice that he
canâ€™t explain and works it into his readings.</font></font></div>
