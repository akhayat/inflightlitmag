Piche was born in San Diego, California. She lived her life at the
beach enjoying the soothing sounds of retired surfers and holistic
healers. She shifted her atmosphere dramatically when she moved to
Los Angeles 7 years ago to pursue her writing career. Today she lives
out her days gallivanting through streets, stores, coffee shops, and
bars in search of her next story. She is fascinated by the human
condition, and goes to great lengths to understand the psychology of
people that stand out in society.</font></font></font></div>
