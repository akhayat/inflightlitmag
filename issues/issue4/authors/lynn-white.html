White lives in north Wales. Her work is influenced by issues of
social justice and events, places and people she has known or
imagined. She is especially interested in exploring the boundaries of
dream, fantasy and reality. Her poem 'A Rose For Gaza' was
shortlisted for the Theatre Cloud 'War Poetry for Today' competition
in October 2014 and has since been published in the ‘Poetry For
Change Anthology by Vending Machine Press and in Weasel Press
'Degenerates: Voices For Peace' Anthology. Poems have also recently
been included in Harbinger Asylum's Journal and 'A Moment To Live By'
Anthology, Stacey Savage's ‘We Are Poetry an Anthology of Love
poems’, ITWOW's 'She Did It Anyway' Anthology among others.</font></font></div>
