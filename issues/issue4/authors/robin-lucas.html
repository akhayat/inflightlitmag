in the Inland Empire of Southern California, an area notorious for
including San Bernardino. Its other notable attractions include the
highest concentration of meth labs in the state, the worst
particulate smog in the country, and the third most hyper-inflated
housing market in American history.* The author calls it the “Inbred

began writing at 22, mostly by accident, for the same reasons many
writers began writing by accident: 1) he had a typewriter, 2) he had
plenty of time thanks to being underemployed, and 3) he had a sudden
urge to express his festering self-indulgence (third-person bios, for
example). He continues to write for similar reasons, except #1
because his typewriter was eventually stolen—probably by an
irritated roommate tired of hearing the keys tapping at all hours of
the night. He published his first poem at 26, and this will mark his
first publication anywhere since then. He blogs at
