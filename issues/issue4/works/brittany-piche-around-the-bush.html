<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You’re
young, you have your whole life ahead of you, and you can do
something with your life.” &nbsp;He mumbled, staring at the popcorn
ceiling. I couldn’t look at him either. The conversation was too
stale. I knew then that was the last time we would ever be together.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It’s
just hard—”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don’t”
He turned on his side to face me.&nbsp;I loved how his eyes were
always so worn. Like they had seen so much, but still managed to form
a perfect shade of glass blue; the only piece of him that wasn’t
distorted by age. The only true innocence that was left of him. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Just
start over,” he enforced as his hand warmed my thigh. I let out a
deep breath.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Stop.”
I always hated when he said that. &nbsp;</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
tilted my head towards him, “Alright”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Whether
he meant it or not I can’t think that way. He had too many ulterior
motives to send me away, and my conclusion has never been that he
wanted what was best for me. He was too afraid to come out and say he
was over what we had and he wanted me to leave him.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
hear people talk about how they wish they would have known it would
be the last time they would share a moment with someone.&nbsp;Like
they would have done something different.</font></font></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">For
me it was more of a loss. I knew it was the end and I froze.&nbsp;I
tried to stop the end from coming and didn’t enjoy what was
occurring. It was the loss of fluid movement and connection. There
was no energy in the way we handled each other. People fall apart for
numerous different reasons. I’m just glad I will never be the
asshole that beats around the bush.</font></font></div>
