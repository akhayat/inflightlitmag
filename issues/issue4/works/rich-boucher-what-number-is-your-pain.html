doctor’s receptionist hands me the intake form. I sit down. I fill
it out: What is your name. Are you sure this is your name. Why is
this your name. Did anyone unknown to you give you this name. Why are
you here. What hurts. Describe the pain. Why aren’t you somewhere
else. Briefly describe the pain. Describe the pain at length.
Describe the pain using elaborate metaphor. Describe how long the
pain lasts. Does the pain have any distinguishing features, like
scars or tattoos. Are you sure you are in pain. Did anyone unknown to
you give you this pain. Describe where on your body the pain resides.
Does the pain reside there, or is it just visiting. Is anyone
pressuring you to discuss this pain. Why are you in pain. Do you
think you deserve this pain. Why do you think you don’t deserve
this pain. Would you like to nominate someone else to receive this
pain. How come you’re complaining about this pain. Forget about the
fact that there are other people in the waiting room with you: what
is so special about you that you think you should ask the doctor to
take away this pain. You may either strongly agree or weakly
disagree: do you smoke or do drugs or engage in sexual activity with
more than ten brand new strangers in a month. Do you know anyone who
does drugs or smokes or engages in sexual activity with more than ten
brand new strangers in a month. If yes, please list the names and
phone numbers of any people you know who smoke or do drugs or engage
in sexual activity with more than ten brand new strangers in a month,
and supply a ranking order of these people from the most attractive
to the least attractive. Also indicate whether any of these people
are into receptionists.</font></font></font></div>
