<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Your
grandma is a magician. Remember that time when you fell off your
bicycle and she lifted you up onto the kitchen counter? She cleaned
your bloody knees, washed the tears and snot off your face, told you
funny stories and tickled your stomach until you giggled so hard it
made you hiccup. The tears, the blood, the pain, your mum’s closed
bedroom door—all vanished, as if your grandma had waved a wand—sim
sala bim! Hard to keep your smile off your face now, no? She did such
things. Still does. A trickster, she is. Always full of pranks and
laughter. Like now, looking so wrinkled and pale in her bed, not
responding. Bet she opens her eyes any moment now with that
mischievous grin of hers, pleased she fooled you. You’ll both
double over in laughing fits. Any moment now.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">The
drive here took longer than usual, even though you left home the same
time as every Sunday. But an accident on King’s Road slowed down
the traffic. The ambulance had already left when you passed the site.
One of the cars had its front pushed inwards. Three grim-faced
firemen stood by the car. The moment you turned onto the narrow
gravel road to your grandma’s, you switched off the engine and sat
watching the boundless fields of tall wheat grass that surround her
house, while your heart hammered in your chest. The sun was high when
you finally started the engine.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">You
don’t know how long you’ve been standing here. Dark clouds
obscure the sky on the other side of the lace curtains. A storm is
brewing; it will hit soon. The old maple tree slams its branches down
on the roof. Better check the loft windows before heading home, even
though the thought of the rickety ladder and the overflowing attic
makes you shudder. </font></font></font></font>

<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Remember
that summer holiday when you spent a whole day up there? When you
found that box full of black and white pictures and letters: stacked
envelopes with a velvet band around them, foreign stamps, and inside,
onion skin paper covered in a neat, curvy handwriting? They whispered
adventure and secrets, didn’t they? Time disappeared, the only
sound the hammering rain on the loft windows. You can’t recall what
the letters said or who they were from, but you still remember one
picture: five gaunt naked men standing in a line, behind them another
line of equally gaunt men, but in weird striped clothing that looked
like pyjamas. In front of them, uniformed men holding raised rifles.
Today you know it was a picture from the war camps and it makes you
uncomfortable to remember the strange excitement, the way you
couldn’t put the picture down; you’d never seen naked men before.

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">At
first you didn’t recognise your mother when she came searching for
you and saw the open box and the picture in your hand. It wasn’t
the first time you saw that face, nor the last: a face twisted in a
grotesque grimace as if possessed by an evil spirit. Today you know
it was the booze she drank in her bedroom that made things snap
inside her; at least that’s what your psychiatrist claims. But a
little child voice inside you insists it was an evil spirit. </font></font></font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Your
mother beat you with her flat hand, then forced you to stand in the
rain for hours with chattering teeth until your skin was numb and
finally your grandma came home and put you in the bath tub and filled
it with hot water, rubbing your stiff legs until they burned. She
mended your wounds, all the time telling you funny stories about the
fluffy cats she’d seen at work that day, how they’d played in the
backyard. She never mentioned the box, but it was gone the next time
you climbed up.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">You
wonder where it is now.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Her
skin is drawn tight over her cheekbones. It looks thin and oddly dry,
almost like vellum paper. Her closed eyes look sunken. She must be
tired. Maybe you should go home and come back tomorrow. But in the
distance you hear a low rumble. Thunder. You hesitate. You’re a
little bit afraid of thunder and lightning. Your grandma isn’t.
She’ll smile and put on the radio when she wakes. Turn the switch
to 94, where they play jazz music from the old days. “Nothing like
some good music to keep the storm clouds away,” she’ll say and
swing her body a little from side to side. And she’ll insist you
stay. “Of course you’re not driving home in this weather. Are you
nuts, girl?”</font></font></font></font></div>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Maybe
you should go downstairs and check the old clock? You can hear
it—tick-tock—even though the wind howls around the corners now.
It could be that </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif"><i>Barcelona

is on: your grandma’s favourite soap. She’s bound to wake up for
sure. Every day she watches it twice: the episode from the day before
and the new episode. On Sundays, when you’re there, she keeps
glancing at you to see if you like it. So if you pretend to watch,
even though your mind wanders, and also ask questions about the
characters, it’s as if you’re giving her a shiny gift. She
explains it all to you in detail: That dark-haired business man is
not to be trusted, and that doctor has an evil twin, and that
beautiful lady has amnesia. Her commentary always makes you laugh,
and your grandma beams.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Her
crooked fingers have dark spots and yellowed nails. The veins travel
blue over her white hands. When she wakes up, you must help her with
her nails. Polish them in that dark pink colour she loves, just like
her climbing roses outside: her pride. Her wedding ring has slid down
and hangs loose on her knuckle. It puzzles you why she still wears
it. People in this town think highly of your grandfather. “A
righteous man”, they say. “Old school. No doubts about which side
to take when the occupation came. Wish we had more men like him
today. Too bad he was killed by the occupation forces.” </font></font></font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">You’ve
never met your grandpa but you loathe him, even though he’s dead.</font></font></font></font></div>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">That
Sunday last month when you found your grandma at the kitchen table,
her breath whispering of the scotch from the bottle in front of her
and her clear eyes brimming with heavy thoughts—your breath still
hitches at the memory. She looked up, confused, when you entered. “Is
it Sunday?” Then she burst into tears. Awkwardly, you patted her
hand and poured her another glass of scotch. You’ve never been good
at showing affection. She wiped her eyes with an embroidered napkin,
blew her nose. “Today’s the day your grandfather died,” she
said. Unsure about how to respond, you murmured something in
sympathy, but she waved her small hand in the air to stop you and
maybe it was the scotch that made her speak frankly: “I hated him.
I’m glad he’s dead.” </font></font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">That
was the only time you’ve drunk scotch. Your stomach can’t take
strong liquors. But the situation seemed to require scotch. Good
thing she had another bottle.</font></font></font></font></div>

<font color="#000000">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">He
had such a temper,” she said. “I don’t know how many times I
found her hiding in the attic, crying, shaking with fear. That poor
little thing. I tried to shield her, you know. Took a few blows
myself.” At this, it was your turn to cry. Your grandma handed you
a napkin. She seemed relieved to have a listener. “We had peace
from him during the occupation, your mother and I. Because he was so
busy with the resistance movement and because he got himself a
mistress. Friends of ours were arrested and brought to the camps.”
She stared into the distance and you thought of the picture in the
attic. Your cheeks burned with shame.</font></font></font></font></div>

<font color="#000000">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">He
left it to us to tend the fields and manage as best we could during
winter. I hid the ration cards from him, or he would have spent it
all on his mistress. I knew where she lived. Often I thought I’d go
and yell at them, make a scene, but then I’d look at your mother
and I didn’t.”</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Thunder
and lightning lit the bedroom in white flashes. Your grandma looks so
pale and fragile in her sleep. Innocent, even. You wonder if she lied
to you or if you remember it all wrong. There was a lot of scotch
after all. But at some point, you’re sure she slurred: “I killed
him. Out there in the fields, I killed him.” Surely you heard it
wrong, you think. An unknown man killed your grandfather. At least
that’s what the occupation officers said. Local people thought that
the occupation forces were responsible, that they’d somehow found
out he was involved in the resistance activities. He was shot in the
head. </font></font></font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">Your
mother suffered the same destiny. You were at a classmate’s
birthday party on the other side of the fields. Police officers came
to pick you up and drive you home. Something lay on the ground in
front of the house, covered with a blanket. And you knew. Your
grandma reached her arms out towards you, gave you a fierce hug.
“It’s just you and me now.” </font></font></font></font>
</div>

<font color="#000000">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Such
an unfortunate family,” they say when you walk through the streets.</font></font></font></font></div>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">You
are tired. The leg cramps force you to sit down on the edge of the
bed. Your grandma doesn’t move. Her face looks ancient and white in
the flashes of distant lightning. The storm has passed and it’s
heading towards town. The rain taps on the window frames. It’s dark
now. The bedside lamp’s red shade casts a warm glow when you switch
it on. Your grandma’s face softens in the pool of yellow light, but
her eyes are closed. Strong, you think. She looks strong. She takes
care of you, always has.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.59in;   ">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Garamond, serif">It’s
impossible to stop yawning. The yawns bring tears to your eyes. You
consider taking a nap. Your grandma will think it’s funny when she
wakes up and finds you here. It’s too late to drive home anyway.
Exhausted, you lay down next to her. The blankets are cold and you
shudder. The last thing you see before you fall asleep is the profile
of your grandma’s nose and chin against the lamp. Her hair is
ruffled. “In the morning I’ll comb it, Grandma,” you whisper.
Smiling, you close your eyes. She’s fooled you well this time, the
old trickster.</font></font></font></font></div>
