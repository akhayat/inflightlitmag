<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
had never hit someone out of anger in my life; there was a time I
thought I never needed to. I had never been someone with rage or
outbursts. As a child I was shy and quiet, but as the years passed I
began to notice that nothing was ever solved without action.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
couldn’t go on living my quiet life, letting people wash over me. I
had to do something before it was too late.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
was never my friend, as much as I gave people the chance to do good,
she was always out for blood. I could see it in her piercing green
and blue eyes that nothing fazed her anymore. Maybe she used to be
quiet too; life tends to have that effect on most people I run into.
When you try so hard to do right and it never works out, one day you
just give up, and you get this gleam in your eyes. This dead silence
like a door you know will never be opened. There was nothing left but
her instinct to survive.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We
met at a restaurant because it was public. Who knew that with that
much rage inside someone, it didn’t matter where you were? Public
or private, if a flame is dropped on gasoline, it burns. She teased
and pried and I kept calm for a moment. I just needed it all to stop.
The&nbsp;calls, the meetings, the useless knowledge, the yelling.
None of this changed the circumstances&nbsp;and as far as I was
concerned it had gone on far too long.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Where’s
my money?” She hissed through yellow-stained teeth.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It’s
not even yours, I can’t do this anymore,” I pleaded.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Do
what?” In a tone more forceful than necessary.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Talk
to you. It’s too much, and it’s pointless.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Fuck
you! You’re trash, you’re all trash,” coming from an addict I
didn’t take it too personally.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It’s
not even yours to have, so I don’t understand why you think you
deserve it.”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Her
eyes shifted away from me. She was caught off guard for the first
time in the years I had known her. She knew nothing was hers for the
taking,&nbsp;but she thought that she had made this work between us.
Our “friendship” would surpass what was right and I would support
her through her husband’s incarceration. Truth is, when someone
goes inside in this business, they might as well be dead. Yes, I owed
him a lot of money, yes I was going to pay it back, no I didn’t
think this would happen, and yes, I would’ve done the right thing,
if only it were that easy.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
wasn’t that easy, there were too many angles to look at. If I gave
her the money she would spend it carelessly. She’d buy a new house
in a completely different area, change her number, separate herself
from everyone, and never be seen again. Then suddenly it is five
years later, he is out, and he wants his money; that is what I don’t
want to deal with.&nbsp;I don’t need a convict knocking on my door
at my&nbsp;adorable&nbsp;home in the suburbs with my husband and kids
out front playing hopscotch.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
thought we had an agreement–”</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Those
were the last coherent words&nbsp;I can remember. It all just went
fuzzy after that. Sounds were coming from her mouth, but it was words
I couldn’t understand, nothing was processing, it was all mumbles
and screeches.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
was thinking about my kids, and my life, and everything I was trying
to do, and she seemed like a nice person on the outside, but I knew
she wasn’t. I had been taken advantage of. She knew I had a heart
and she wanted to use it to her advantage. She didn’t care what
happened to me, she was looking out for herself, and who could blame
her, but I was not the one that would fall deeper into this hole.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
looked down and saw my hands shaking. My entire body was pulsating
uncontrollably. I looked back up to her; her lips had stopped moving.
I didn’t know what to do, I had nothing to say, I didn’t even
know what she had said. Before I knew it my fist contacted her face,
and she was thrown off her chair. I looked around the restaurant,
nobody had seemed to notice the dispute, so I did the only thing I
could. I ran out. My hand was bloody, must have caught it on her
earring or something, so I wrapped it in a tissue and drove away.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
was forever changed after that day. I never thought that I could ever
harm another human being, but I can’t say I’m not happy about it.
There was never another word about any of it. I had handled the
situation the only way I could. The next month it was back to kids’
soccer practices, PTA meetings, and house work. That meeting had
changed me, though. In a way I proved to myself that I could stand my
ground and do what needed to be done to protect my&nbsp;family.</font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Garamond, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
anyone ever tries to take advantage again, they are fucking with the
wrong soccer mom.</font></font></div>
