<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">La
Colorada was a small village in the middle of the Mexican desert. A
small piece of dry earth haunted by bad weather and trapped in the
past. The outside world was a story, something that happened to a
friend of a friend; a mysterious neighbor rarely allowed in.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Its
citizens used to work as perfectly as machinery, everyone fitted so
well into their job and into each other that the entire city was one
huge engine, running day and night, every little piece as important
as the next. Arms entwined so tight it seemed impossible to let go.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">They
had been too busy surviving to notice time threatening to jump up
their fences. </font></font></font></font>
</div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">One
morning, on their way to the fields, the men found an old man with a
big, foreign hat sitting on the grass right in front of the biggest
mountain. “What are you doing on the ground old man?” they asked
him “Are you traveling? Come to one of our houses, we’ll feed you
and our kids will play with you.” But the old man politely reclined
“I Can’t move, I’m waiting for Rezende, he´ll come down this
mountain any day now,” he declared, then turned his head and didn’t
mutter another word.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">After
a few days they got used to his presence and stopped trying to take
him home, instead they regarded him simply as a spot of the
landscape. They would wave at him, he would wave back, the sun would
be up, the man sitting, the grass down.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">And
weeks passed, and the seasons changed, and they would keep passing
him by every morning on their way to work “Still waiting old man?”
“Maybe you have the wrong mountain” They would joke, call him
crazy, make fun of him, but he never lost his temper, all he would
say was, “I’m just waiting for Rezende, he’ll come down that
mountain any day now to take me.”</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">They
would discuss the old man at their parties, they didn’t understand
him and it made them nervous, and they would laugh at him, and the
kids would joke and knock at the bathroom door, “C´mon hurry up!
What are you doing in there? Waiting for Rezende?”</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">But
so it happened, that one idle Monday on their way to work the old man
wasn’t there anymore, all they could find was the hat he used to
wear, now cold from the morning mist.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">He
did it!” They all cheered “Rezende came for him!”</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">After
that day Rezende became an extra habitant on all homes. “If you
don’t finish your vegetables you can’t go wait for Rezende when
you grow up,” parents would say. And the men bought hats and quit
their jobs and went to sit there too, day and all night waiting for
Rezende.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Trouble
entered the city around that time. The fields were abandoned; so the
neglected animals began getting stolen, getting eaten by coyotes,
getting too thin, dying. Things that had always flowed as naturally
as water in the village were now becoming a problem: food, work,
love.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">And
the wives were unhappy for the first time, they started yelling; this
made men began to feel uncomfortable in their homes so they would
leave earlier and return later. The mothers were so upset that they
would take it out on their kids. The kids couldn’t understand why,
but they started fighting each other, skipping school, they were
hungry too and that put them in a new mood, they started stealing,
then they started hating themselves for doing it. They felt on both
ends of a war they never meant to fight.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">The
old grandmothers worried and went to the mountain to build a
beautiful shrine so Rezende would like them better and side with the
women. So females were spending their entire day out there also,
making the monument pretty, getting fresh flowers, giving away the
love no one else was taking. They left their homes too.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">And
the village, like the cattle, got too thin and began to die. Sad to
see their old lives a skeleton, the people rarely came back.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Now
if you pass by the mountain you will find a line of men in white hats
sitting on one side, waiting, and a breathtaking monument surrounded
by women out of breath on the other. The waiters.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">Meanwhile,
out of their view, the ghost city is waking up, the kids, sons of
nobody, never understood so they made peace, they plant, they water,
they care. Trees start growing, houses get painted, food grows again
and songs get singed.</font></font></font></font></div>
<div style="text-indent: 0.5in;   ">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Garamond, serif">The
kids hung a sign at the entrance of the city “Rezende”. And now,
their heats warm, they don’t wait, they live.</font></font></font></font></div>
