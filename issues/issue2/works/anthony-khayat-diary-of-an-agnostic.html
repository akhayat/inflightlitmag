	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond">When I was a kid, way, way back&mdash;we're
	talking when most channels were still in black and white&mdash;my
	parents had front row seats to church every single Sunday. Back
	then, God was this...<I>presence</I> that I felt when I was alone,
	pouring out of the walls and nudging my brain. Or at least, I
	thought I felt it. I wasn't really sure if it was all in my head or
	whatever. And every night, before I went to sleep, I'd ask that
	presence for the most important things in the world according to
	nine-year-old boys&mdash;ice cream, cap guns, baseball cards, blah,
	blah, blah. This was before Game Boys, but if they were around, I'm
	sure one would be sitting pretty at the top of the list. Anyway,
	most of the time it didn't work, and I asked my parents and my
	priest and my teachers why not, and they told me he doesn't just
	<I>give</I> you what you ask for like some kind of omnipresent
	genie. </FONT>
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond">After that message sunk in, I started to
	think that maybe God was just the police chief&mdash;there to punish
	you when you call your classmate an idiot after he swears Africa's a
	country, or when you scrape your asparagus off your plate and into
	the garbage while your parents aren't watching, or you shout &quot;Jesus
	Fucking Christ&quot; after the older kids set of those firecrackers
	behind the school. So, of course I did all of these, and I
	frantically bargained with the &quot;presence,&quot; offering to
	throw some of my allowance into the church collection basket on
	Sunday and swear off swearing.  Oh, Jesus, I remember when puberty
	hit, and I figured out how jerking off worked. Supposedly it's this
	big sin, but I was thirteen, and I had this lust-guilt relationship
	with my dad's old Marilyn Monroe issue of <I>Playboy.</I> I had to
	make more deals with God than I had cash in my little ceramic piggy
	bank. So of course I blew him off. And I knew that he knew I was
	blowing him off. Every night I braced for a lightning strike or an
	earthquake or Satan bursting from the ground or <I>something</I>.
	But it never came. So I started testing the limit. I stole a dollar
	from the ice cream store at school. I flipped my dad off when he
	wasn't looking. I ditched Sunday mass to meet my friends at the
	local donut shop. And after all of it, I still had ten fingers and
	ten toes. That's when I was <I>sure</I> the presence was in my head
	the whole time, and it didn't seem so...well, <I>present</I>...but
	how could all these adults pretend to feel it?  Maybe there was a
	God, but he was more of the hands-off ruler of the universe?</FONT><DT>
	<BR>
	<DT><FONT FACE="Garamond">I was still trying to figure all that out
	when I turned eighteen, and the little more hands-on rulers of the
	U.S. gifted me front row tickets to see the exotic jungles of
	Vietnam. Non-refundable, non-returnable, and sure as hell
	non-refusable. So there in the greenery, the rain, the gunfire, and
	the grenades, me and the <FONT COLOR="#000000">twenty-five terrified
	kids next to me all asked God to save our skin, and in the back of
	my head, I knew</FONT></FONT><DT>
	 <FONT FACE="Garamond">this was it.  This is where the retribution
	came. The punishment for all the lying, stealing, and copious
	masturbating...except the battle ended. And I was still breathing.
	And Danny over there with the bullet through the eye, Danny was a
	kid that said please and thank you and always asked if you wanted
	some of his peanuts when he opened a bag. And, yeah, Jimmy over
	there with his spleen spilling out was a fucking monster&mdash;a
	complete and utter sociopath&mdash;one of the ones that got off
	watching the men drop to the floor at the other end of his scope.
	But there were just as many Dannys as Jimmys lying there on the
	ground, and I couldn't help thinking, if someone's up there
	orchestrating all this, they must be rolling some fucking dice or
	something.  Once in a while, I'd get a glimpse of the other sides'
	corpses, with the smooth faces and frightened eyes, and I just <I>knew</I>
	most of them were praying to someone, same as me, same as Danny. It
	all seemed so...<I>random</I>.</FONT><DT>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>It made me
	think about people a thousand miles away, who don't even believe in
	this God.  They're sitting there with their Buddha or Allah or
	Vishnu or Thor or whatever the fuck hanging over them, and I
	could've just as easily been born there, with tanner skin and a
	turban, and that presence could've been called anything else. I
	don't know. Maybe it's like a Hemingway story, and all the signs are
	there, swimming below the surface, too deep for my shallow mind to
	catch, but worshiped by all the ones who get it. Or maybe all these
	people are just making shit up. Either way, I don't read much
	Hemingway anymore.</FONT></FONT></FONT></DL>
