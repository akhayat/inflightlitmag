Ray Bradbury)<BR><BR>These nights, the cats drag autumn back to me
like freshly caught prey.<BR>Tiny burrs nestle amongst thick-fingered
fur:<BR>Their bodies wriggle as I seek to lift and pick and
clean.<BR>They carry the scent of night along with them;<BR>Of
careful movements through waning hedges,<BR>Thick with the darkly
clustered final fruits of autumn,<BR>Sweet with grass once warmed by
the clear-eyed sun.<BR>There is a wildness in them, now, that I have
not seen before;<BR>Eyes look above me to the distance -<BR>No longer
fixed to mine for attention, approbation -<BR>Nostrils flared in a
heady moment for the scent of prey.<BR>They stop - briefly - for
moments of love that they still remember,<BR>Then glide, silent,
beneath stars that will coldly guide their way.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
