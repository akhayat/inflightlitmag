think I am going to melt<BR>I say in a southern accent<BR>as if I
possess<BR>the constitution<BR>of a graceful antebellum beauty<BR>or
an ice cube<BR>that is stupid<BR>I dreamt of a large, clean<BR>ideal
workspace<BR>like a cartoon dog<BR>dreams of steak<BR>every time i
think something's funny<BR>I should write it down<BR>why do i
exist?<BR>what is it <BR>I am trying for?<BR>aw, haw—haw—haw!<BR>I
laughed that in a southern accent<BR>oh, this, this dumb thing, it—
life<BR>keeps going<BR>It's just like how<BR>bacteria outsmarts<BR>each
and every advancement<BR>in antibacterial soap<BR>why might one <BR>want
to be around me?<BR>who is one?<BR>I am many<BR>why haven't I
felt<BR>too manic in a while?<BR>online dating is the pits<BR>I have,
like, so many stupid verbal ticks<BR>I sweat so much when i walk<BR>way
more than most ladies<BR>and I always get nervous<BR>honestly, really
really worried<BR>that if there's a fly near me<BR>it's because I
actually smell<BR>like a cartoon piece of shit<BR>I miss my mom more
than a little bit<BR>but I can't admit it<BR>my hips are so damn
big<BR>and I could be a size 6<BR>if it weren't for<BR>my thighs<BR>and
the rest of my body<BR>let's be clear<BR>in this poem, I am speaking
to<BR>a group of people<BR>in a big room<BR>called the universe<BR>and
I'ma lay down<BR>some ground rules<BR>we've got to be more open<BR>about
the grosser functions of the human body<BR>we must accept the brine
and the bacteria<BR>if we ever want to advance <BR>as a human
race<BR>discuss: romantic love<BR>discuss: the idiocy of hugging
<BR>discuss: sexually transmitted happiness<BR>discuss: I'm probably
sweating<BR>I dreamt of being<BR>a weird mermaid <BR>in my sleep—
<BR>I'm so nervous<BR>about dry skin<BR>about asymmetry<BR>am I
irregular?<BR>I know that I am, but what if I am<BR>irregularly
irregular?<BR>I will freak out about my margin of error<BR>mermaids
are encouraged to have<BR>a supple chest size, and to be <BR>super
fuckable<BR>the best kinds<BR>have a small waist<BR>and they're
supposed to have long, flowing hair<BR>I'm kind of already drowning
in sea water<BR>Here you won't find any sort<BR>of elegant

newborn child<BR>on its head</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
