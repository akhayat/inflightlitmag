	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He was sitting in his office
	and looking noncommittally at the grille through his half closed
	door; no, perhaps it was half opened.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>He was not sure; he was
	thinking differently. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>For sure he was not focused
	but he counted ten grilles till three girls passed and disrupted his
	personal mathematical activity. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'I missed the last one.'he
	said to himself. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'Missing something and
	missing someone are my destiny now.'he thought for a moment.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'But how can I be responsible
	for someone else's idiosyncrasies.'another thought pacifies him a
	bit. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>A girl who changes her
	profile pictures in every fifteen minutes cannot guarantee any
	relationship&mdash;either traditional or modern.  Yes, they were in
	a trendy live-in relationship for <FONT COLOR="#000000">the</FONT>
	past two months, until one fine day Kamya announced that 'I want to
	move out, I quit.'</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>There were no questions asked,
	and consequently no one had to listen to stupid answers. 'God is
	gracious,'he thought. At least this time she couldn't irritate him
	<FONT COLOR="#000000">with</FONT> her long monotonous
	quasi-philosophical speeches. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Kamya used to say, Rajat
	pondered, 'I am like a river&ndash;untamed and intractable; build
	big dams to capture me.'</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>When he was busy in releasing
	himself, he only wanted to float in rather than erecting anything
	non-significant.</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Time flew very fast when she was
	with him. Every night was a party, and each day a festival. As every
	vacation ends, his Saturdays and Sundays &mdash; Kamya's love and
	their live-in relationship ended abruptly. Now her new lover like
	Monday was mocking at him, saying &mdash; 'Work hard you <FONT COLOR="#000000">louse</FONT>!'</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Anyway,</FONT>
	he was single again, and desperately waiting for a new companion.
	Rajat's chain of thought broke when he heard a knock on his
	half-open, half-closed door.  A long blonde girl, not beautiful but
	reasonably pretty, peeped inside his office with a request 'May I
	come in?'</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>Her accent was weird. But he was
	also not interested in <FONT COLOR="#000000">her</FONT> brain.
	Rather, her body would appease him. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'Yes, how could I help
	you?'he said. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'Actually, hmm&hellip;'she
	stammered a little, and then said 'I am Kamya's friend Soniya.'</FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em">
	<FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'Look,'he interrupted the new
	girl, but he was re-interrupted by Soniya. </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>'I am single <FONT COLOR="#000000">nowadays</FONT>,
	and interested in you.'she said quite explicitly.  </FONT></FONT>
	<DT style="text-indent:2em"><FONT FACE="Garamond"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time since
	their separation, he thanked Kamya for her generosity, and welcomed
	the new guest with a broad smile.</FONT></FONT></DL>
