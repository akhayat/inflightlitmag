you my lifesaver. You who are sinking in the ocean alone. I didn't
see you diving over the edge, but you say you want to sink under,
feel the weight of ocean crush your chest. I know it gets exhausting.
I know because when I dove down as deep, I grew gills. It was dark
for so many years I stopped believing in sunlight. Breath is memory.
You will remember how music makes you dance, but water keeps it from
you. You can't move through currents like hallways. You, gill growing
boy. I keep throwing down ropes but you are not done sinking. You
still need the weight, so I will wait for you. Watch you from the
surface while you walk ocean. I don't know when your arms will grow
strong enough to pull yourself up, so I give you my pen. Write me
letters. Send them up on rays of sunlight. I will keep them at my
heart until you are ready to surface.</FONT></FONT></BODY>
