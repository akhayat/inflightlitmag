Khayat started writing in the fourth grade when he turned in a
page-and-a-half for a two-sentence assignment. His teacher yelled at
him, and he promptly gave up the dream until college, when a paper on
procrastination made his classmates laugh. When he discovered he had
the power to make people like him this way, he took to writing as a
hobby for what is probably the unhealthiest reason possible.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
